   abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the dc power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the nonlinearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the nonlinear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the nonlinear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested dc power) over those designed based on the linear model and over nonadaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a nonlinear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multiantenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the nonlinearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

In the WET-MM system, the H-AP is equipped with a large number M of antennas and functions like a conventional AP in receiving data from users, but additionally supplies wireless power to the users. We consider frame-based transmissions. Each frame is divided into three phases: the uplink channel estimation (CE) phase, the downlink WET phase, as well as the uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) phase. Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously harvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels and obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the H-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy to all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a portion of the harvested energy to send data to the H-AP simultaneously in the uplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame). To optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum rate among all users. In the large- M regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solutions and some interesting insights for the optimal design of WET-MM system.},

Currently, the community is experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress in laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for wireless information and power transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely, simultaneous WIPT (SWIPT), wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), and wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely, one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architectures, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification.

   abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long- range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to given minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that under the condition of independently distributed user channels, no dedicated energy beam is used for the case of Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for the case of Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality for our studied downlink beamforming problems, and thereby develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as by SDR. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of proposed optimal beamforming designs for MISO SWIPT systems. © 2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {High-efficiency rectennas for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting have been studied for decades, but most of the literature straightforwardly applies the rectenna aiming at dedicated RF sources to this situation, even though the level of input power is significantly different. Since previous studies address antenna design collecting more ambient RF power, the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has emerged in a scattered way, because the theoretical limit of PCE has not yet been characterized, and the optimal rectenna structure approaching such maximum PCE is still uninvestigated. In this paper, we characterize the performance limit of rectennas with input power ranging from -20 to 0 dBm, proposing optimal rectenna design demonstrating the maximum PCE. The maximum achievable PCE is cast into a mathematical programming problem. Solving this optimization model clarifies the effect of design factors, including operational frequencies, rectifier topologies, and parameterization. To achieve the maximum PCE, our investigation shows that the optimal rectenna structure should not only optimize those design factors but also eliminate the matching circuit between an antenna and a rectifier for ultralow-power scenarios. The resultant PCE at 2.45 GHz is 61.4% and 31.8% at -5 and -15 dBm, respectively, closely approaching the theoretical bound.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.},

   abstract = {Super-resolution is generally referred to as the task of recovering fine details from coarse information. Motivated by applications, such as single-molecule imaging, radar imaging, etc., we consider parameter estimation of complex exponentials from their modulations with unknown waveforms, allowing for non-stationary blind super-resolution. This problem, however, is ill-posed since both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the modulating waveforms are unknown. To alleviate this, we assume that the unknown waveforms live in a common low-dimensional subspace. Using a lifting trick, we recast the blind super-resolution problem as a structured low-rank matrix recovery problem. Atomic norm minimization is then used to enforce the structured low-rankness, and is reformulated as a semidefinite program that is solvable in polynomial time. We show that, up to scaling ambiguities, exact recovery of both of the complex exponential parameters and the unknown waveforms is possible when the waveform subspace is random and the number of measurements is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, showing that non-stationary blind super-resolution using atomic norm minimization is possible.},

Instead of directly resorting to semi-definite relaxation, we convert the initial non-convex optimization to a power allocation problem, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. The beamforming vectors are proven to be scaled versions of the estimated channels. The optimal scaling factors are then derived in closed-form.

MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck toward enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate CSIT. This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this article, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages, and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability, and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions. Open problems, the impact on standard specifications, and operational challenges are also discussed.},

In order to operate the detector at even lower power levels, a strategy to optimize the modulated WuR excitations is presented, exploiting high-peak intermittent continuous waves while preserving the required average power per bit. The design and implementation of an ultralow-power detector, fed by a dual-band antenna and loaded by the WuR backend is presented: 2.45-GHz and 868-MHz operations of the same WuR are demonstrated, with added flexibility and interoperability among different communication bands. We show that a correct WuR activation is possible with an average power per bit as low as -63 dBm at 2.45 GHz and -65 dBm at 868 MHz.

   abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the users harvest energy and decode information using the same signals received from a fixed access point (AP). For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called "outage-energy" region and "rate-energy" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. The effects of circuit energy consumption at the receiver on the achievable rate-energy trade-offs are also characterized.

The differences and the implications of these two approaches are explained in terms of their energy efficiency and transmission distance capabilities. The differences between the system energy efficiency and the transmission efficiency are also highlighted. The review covers the two-coil systems, the four-coil systems, the systems with relay resonators and the wireless domino-resonator systems. Related issues including human exposure issues and reduction of winding resistance are also addressed. The review suggests that the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in the two-coil systems is suitable for short-range rather than mid-range applications, the use of the maximum power transfer principle in the four-coil systems is good for maximizing the transmission distance, but is under a restricted system energy efficiency (<50%); the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in relay or domino systems may offer a good compromise for good system energy efficiency and transmission distance on the condition that relay resonators can be placed between the power source and the load. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous transmission of information and power over a point-to-point complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel is studied. In contrast with the literature that relies on an inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester, an experimentally-validated nonlinear model is considered. A general form of the delivered Direct Current (DC) power in terms of system baseband parameters is derived, which demonstrates the dependency of the delivered DC power on higher order statistics of the channel input distribution. The optimization problem of maximizing Rate-Power (R-P) region is studied. Assuming that the Channel gain is known at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel inputs determined only by their first and second moment statistics, an inner bound for the general problem is obtained. Notably, as a consequence of the harvester nonlinearity, the studied inner bound exhibits a tradeoff between the delivered power and the rate of received information. It is shown that the tradeoff-characterizing input distribution is with mean zero and with asymmetric power allocations to the real and imaginary dimensions.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications and design aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control combined with the conventional transmission control can potentially bring performance gain compared to the conventional wireless networks without using the IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks to some emerging wireless applications. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges and future research directions of realizing IRS-assisted wireless communications in beyond 5G networks.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to build a programmable wireless environment for future communication systems. In practice, an IRS consists of massive low-cost elements, which can steer the incident signal in fully customizable ways by passive beamforming. In this paper, we consider an IRS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system. In particular, the weighted sum-rate of all users is maximized by joint optimizing the active beamforming at the base-station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the IRS. In addition, we consider a practical IRS assumption, in which the passive elements can only shift the incident signal to discrete phase levels. This non-convex problem is firstly decoupled via Lagrangian dual transform, and then the active and passive beamforming can be optimized alternatingly. The active beamforming at BS is optimized based on the fractional programming method. Then, three efficient algorithms with closed-form expressions are proposed for the passive beamforming at IRS. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms as compared to different benchmark schemes.},

In the proposed structure, graphene is utilized as a cross patch FSS, which is low-profile and tunable. The FSS structure shows a wide stop-band (-15 dB) from 1.1 THz to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between the elements of the nano-antenna array, a high isolation of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall is achieved, which indicates that mutual decoupling effects are suppressed for both two-element and four-element arrays. The radiation patterns are given to confirm that the proposed FSS structure can improve the performance of multi-band THz antenna arrays with negligible influence on the nano-antenna radiation performance. Finally, it is asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of very large number of closely integrated elements.},

FSS is a periodic surface with identical two-dimensional arrays of elements arranged on a dielectric substrate. An incoming plane wave will either be transmitted (passband) or reflected back (stopband), completely or partially, depending on the nature of array element. This occurs when the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) wave matches with the resonant frequency of the FSS elements. Therefore, an FSS is capable of passing or blocking the EM waves of certain range of frequencies in the free space; consequently, identified as spatial filters. Nowadays, FSSs have been studied comprehensively and huge growth is perceived in the field of its designing and implementation for different practical applications at frequency ranges of microwave to optical. In this review article, we illustrate the recent researches on different categories of FSSs based on structure design, array element used, and applications. We also focus on theoretical breakthroughs with fabrication techniques, experimental verifications of design examples as well as prospects and challenges, especially in the microwave regime. We emphasize their significant performance parameters, particularly focusing on how advancement in this field could facilitate innovation in advanced electromagnetics.},

   abstract = {Fractional programming (FP) refers to a family of optimization problems that involve ratio term(s). This two-part paper explores the use of FP in the design and optimization of communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP problem - in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming. The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.},

PAB relies on the piezoelectric effect to enable underwater communication and sensing at near-zero power. Its architecture is inspired by radio backscatter which works well in air but cannot work well underwater due to the exponential attenuation of radio signals in water. PAB nodes harvest energy from underwater acoustic signals using piezoelectric interfaces and communicate by modulating the piezoelectric impedance. Our design introduces innovations that enable concurrent multiple access through circuit-based frequency tuning of backscatter modulation and a MAC that exploits the properties of PAB nodes to deliver higher network throughput and decode network collisions. We built a prototype of our design using custom-designed, mechanically fabricated transducers and an end-to-end battery-free hardware implementation.We tested our nodes in large experimental water tanks at the MIT Sea Grant. Our results demonstrate singlelink throughputs up to 3 kbps and power-up ranges up to 10 m. Finally, we show how our design can be used to measure acidity, temperature, and pressure. Looking ahead, the system can be used in ocean exploration, marine life sensing, and underwater climate change monitoring.},

In this system, a multi-antenna access point (AP) uses transmit beamforming to send both information and energy signals to a set of receivers each for information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH), and a dedicatedly deployed IRS properly controls its reflecting phase shifts to form passive reflection beams for facilitating both ID and EH at receivers. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the (active) information and energy transmit beamforming at the AP together with the (passive) reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the minimum power received at all EH receivers, subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at ID receivers, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Although the formulated SINR-constrained min-energy maximization problem is highly non-convex, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed IRS-assisted SWIPT system with both information and energy signals achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes without IRS deployed and/or without dedicated energy signals used.},

In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to harvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through wireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served simultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization and design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being served with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user harvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives the structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where both types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing the results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information users are to be served. The trade-off between the achieved weighted sum rate and the powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the rate-power (R-P) region. Finally, we propose a two-stage user grouping mechanism that decides which users should be scheduled to receive information and which users should be configured to harvest energy from the RF signals in each particular scheduling period, this being one of the main contributions of this paper.},

It has been illustrated that for the synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) scenario, the so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm can accurately and efficiently approximate multiuser MLD. This SDR-MLD algorithm, however, can only handle binary and quadratic phase shift keying (PSK) symbol constellations. In this sequel, we propose an extended SDR algorithm for MLD with M-ary PSK (MPSK) constellations. For the synchronous CDMA scenario, the proposed SDR algorithm provides an attractive polynomial-time complexity order of K3.5, where K is the number of users.

In this letter, we propose and analyse a Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy based on the three-node relay channel where the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas. By splitting user messages and linearly precoding common and private streams at the transmitter, and opportunistically asking the relaying user to forward its decoded common message, CRS can efficiently cope with a wide range of propagation conditions (disparity of user channel strengths and directions) and compensate for the performance degradation due to deep fading. The precoder design and the resource allocation are optimized by solving the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed CRS scheme can achieve an explicit rate region improvement compared to its non-cooperative counterpart and other cooperative strategies (such as cooperative NOMA).},

In existing massive MIMO systems, however, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming. This method results in excessive power consumption and high hardware costs. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS that bears 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. This radical design forms the basis for the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 two-bit elements. The prototype consists of modular hardware and flexible software that encompass the following: the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in wireless communications. We show that, at 2.3 GHz, the proposed RIS can achieve a 21.7 dBi antenna gain. At the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, that is, 28.5 GHz, it attains a 19.1 dBi antenna gain. Furthermore, it has been shown that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.},

   abstract = {RF harvesting circuits have been demonstrated for more than 50 years, but only a few have been able to harvest energy from freely available ambient (i.e., non-dedicated) RF sources. In this paper, our objectives were to realize harvester operation at typical ambient RF power levels found within urban and semi-urban environments. To explore the potential for ambient RF energy harvesting, a city-wide RF spectral survey was undertaken from outside all of the 270 London Underground stations at street level. Using the results from this survey, four harvesters (comprising antenna, impedance-matching network, rectifier, maximum power point tracking interface, and storage element) were designed to cover four frequency bands from the largest RF contributors (DTV, GSM900, GSM1800, and 3G) within the ultrahigh frequency (0.3-3 GHz) part of the frequency spectrum. Prototypes were designed and fabricated for each band. The overall end-to-end efficiency of the prototypes using realistic input RF power sources is measured; with our first GSM900 prototype giving an efficiency of 40%. Approximately half of the London Underground stations were found to be suitable locations for harvesting ambient RF energy using our four prototypes. Furthermore, multiband array architectures were designed and fabricated to provide a broader freedom of operation. Finally, an output dc power density comparison was made between all the ambient RF energy harvesters, as well as alternative energy harvesting technologies, and for the first time, it is shown that ambient RF harvesting can be competitive with the other technologies.© 2013 IEEE.},

The applications are in wireless powering of industrial sensors and recycling of ambient RF energy. A 64-el- ement dual-circularly-polarized spiral rectenna array is designed and characterized over a frequency range of 2–18 GHz with single-tone and multitone incident waves. The integrated design of the antenna and rectifier, using a combination of full-wave electromagnetic field analysis and harmonic balance nonlinear circuit analysis, eliminates matching and filtering circuits, al- lowing for a compact element design. The rectified dc power and efficiency is characterized as a function of dc load and dc circuit topology, RF frequency, polarization, and incidence angle for power densities between 10 S–10 I mW/cmP. In addition, the increase in rectenna efficiency for multitone input waves is presented.},

   abstract = {In wireless cellular or ad hoc networks where Quality of Service (QoS) is interference-limited, a variety of power control problems can be formulated as nonlinear optimization with a system-wide objective, e.g., maximizing the total system throughput or the worst user throughput, subject to QoS constraints from individual users, e.g., on data rate, delay, and outage probability. We show that in the high Signal-toInterference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation. While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been explored before. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control that is geometric- programming-based. These techniques for power control, together with their implications to admission control and pricing in wireless networks, are illustrated through several numerical examples. © 2007 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper studies the coordinated beamforming design problem for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel, assuming only channel distribution information (CDI) known to the transmitters. Under a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and render the optimization problem difficult to handle. Although this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. Hence, the focus of this paper is the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its distributed counterpart indeed converge, and promising performance can be achieved for all the considered system utilities. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper considers transmit optimization in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy capacity or rate of an MIMO channel overheard by one or multiple eavesdroppers. Such optimization problems are nonconvex, and appear to be difficult especially in the multi-eavesdropper scenario. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach to tackle these secrecy optimization problems. We first consider the secrecy capacity maximization (SCM) problem in the single eavesdropper scenario. An AO algorithm is derived through a judicious SCM reformulation. The algorithm conducts some kind of reweighting and water-filling in an alternating fashion, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. We also prove that the AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the SCM problem. Then, we turn our attention to the multiple eavesdropper scenario, where the artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is considered. Although the AN-aided SRM problem has a more complex problem structure than the previous SCM, we show that AO can be extended to deal with the former, wherein the problem is handled by solving convex problems in an alternating fashion. Again, the resulting AO method is proven to have KKT point convergence guarantee. For fast implementation, a custom-designed AO algorithm based on smoothing and projected gradient is also derived. The secrecy rate performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by simulations. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has drawn a lot of attention recently as a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless communication systems. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due to its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the passive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI, while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the optimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training overhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on the I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case, we propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel correlation on the system performance.},

In the proposed protocols, a base station (BS) directly communicates with a NOMA near user, whereas the communication with a NOMA far user is performed with the assistance of an energy-constrained relay node. The relay node harvests energy from the transmitted signal by the BS, employing PS or TS EH technique.

By adjusting the reflection coefficients, the IRS can change the phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves so that it can smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment and enhance the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal. In this paper, we consider downlink multigroup multicast communication systems assisted by an IRS. We aim for maximizing the sum rate of all the multicasting groups by the joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the reflection coefficients at the IRS under both the power and unit-modulus constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose two efficient algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Specifically, a concave lower bound surrogate objective function of each user's rate has been derived firstly, based on which two sets of variables can be updated alternately by solving two corresponding second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive another concave lower bound function of each group's rate for each set of variables at every iteration, and obtain the closed-form solutions under these loose surrogate objective functions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral and energy efficiency of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithms.},

Two main benefits are adaptive beamforming gains and spatial multiplexing, leading to high data rates per user and per cell, especially when large antenna arrays are adopted.

Radically new approaches are required to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in these metrics. There will be large technical challenges, many of which are yet to be identified. In this paper, we survey three new multiple antenna technologies that can play key roles in beyond 5G networks: cell-free massive MIMO, beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces. For each of these technologies, we present the fundamental motivation, key characteristics, recent technical progresses, and provide our perspectives for future research directions. The paper is not meant to be a survey/tutorial of a mature subject, but rather serve as a catalyst to encourage more research and experiments in these multiple antenna technologies.},

Two types of performance evaluations, based on the nonlinear rectenna model and accurate and realistic circuit simulations, are provided. The evaluations demonstrate that the joint waveform and beamforming design can increase the output DC power by leveraging the beamforming gain, the frequency diversity gain, and the rectenna nonlinearity.

   abstract = {The capacity of a complex and discrete-time memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and output delivered power is studied. The output delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints, the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts.},

First, we consider the weighted sum bit error rate (BER) minimization problem among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IRS phase shift matrix, and IRS scheduling, subject to the minimum primary rate requirements. To tackle this complicated problem, a relaxation-based algorithm is proposed. We prove that the converged relaxation scheduling variables are binary, which means that no reconstruct strategy is needed, and thus the UAV rate constraints are automatically satisfied. Second, we consider the fairness BER optimization problem. We find that the relaxation-based method cannot solve this fairness BER problem since the minimum primary rate requirements may not be satisfied by the binary reconstruction operation. To address this issue, we first transform the binary constraints into a series of equivalent equality constraints. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution.

   abstract = {We discuss the powers absorbed and scattered by a receiving antenna. Most antennas scatter more than they absorb. Antennas that scatter less power than they absorb are rare, and the few examples that have been presented are all based on numerical optimization. This note presents a simple conceptual model - a partially transparent aperture antenna - which provides physical insight into the case where the scattering is less than the absorption. Finally, we comment on the far field in the forward-scattering direction, noting that the total field actually is increased, although the scatterer blocks the incident field. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) symbiotic radio (SR) system is proposed, in which an RIS, operating as a secondary transmitter (STx), sends messages to a multi-antenna secondary receiver (SRx) by using cognitive backscattering communication, and simultaneously, it enhances the primary transmission from a multi-antenna primary transmitter (PTx) to a multi-antenna primary receiver (PRx) by intelligently reconfiguring the wireless environment. We are interested in the joint design of active transmit beamformer at the PTx and passive reflecting beamformer at the STx to minimize the total transmit power at the PTx, subject to the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) constraint for the secondary transmission and the rate constraint for the primary transmission. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we decouple the original problem into a series of subproblems using the alternating optimization method and then iteratively solve them. The convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to design the reflecting beamformer by solving a backscatter link enhancement problem through the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique. Then, theoretical analysis is performed to reveal the insights of the proposed system. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the superiority of the proposed system.},

   abstract = {Wireless and batteryless sensing has recently attracted significant attention of researchers in IoT and WSN applications. It turns out to be more challenging when simultaneous data acquisition from multiple sensors is required. This paper introduces a non-orthogonal multiple access technique MSMA, using extremely simple wireless and batteryless sensor tags and a reader to support concurrent streaming from multiple sensors. By simultaneously handling non-orthogonal subcarriers, produced either by multiple or single sensor tag, it can realize concurrent sensor data streaming, which can be used in health monitoring of machinery and civil structures. The paper explains the two primary challenges in MSMA, the optimal assignment of subcarrier frequencies and the unavoidable harmonics from one subcarrier to others. Since the mutual interference among subcarriers is unevenly distributed over the available frequency band, random allocation of subcarrier frequencies may result in degraded system performance. Results show that the interference can be canceled out with the signal processing technique and the system communication capacity can be increased significantly with a proposed heuristic approach compared to random allocation of subcarrier frequencies to the sensor tags.},

With HitchHike, a low power tag reects existing 802.11b transmissions from a commodity WiFi transmitter, and the backscattered signals can then be decoded as a stan-dard WiFi packet by a commodity 802.11b receiver. Hitch-Hike's key invention is a novel technique called codeword translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its information on standard 802.11b packets by just translat-ing the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter com-munication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around 200Kbps.},

The number of AP antennas is significantly larger than the number of users. The system is not partitioned into cells and each user is served by all APs simultaneously. The simplest linear precoding schemes are conjugate beamforming and zero-forcing. Max-min power control provides equal throughput to all users and is considered in this paper. Surprisingly, under max-min power control, most APs are found to transmit at less than full power. The zero-forcing precoder significantly outperforms conjugate beamforming. For zero-forcing, a near-optimal power control algorithm is developed that is considerably simpler than exact max-min power control. An alternative to cell-free systems is small-cell operation in which each user is served by only one AP for which power optimization algorithms are also developed. Cell-free Massive MIMO is shown to provide five-to ten-fold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over small-cell operation.},

   abstract = {We present a method for enhancing far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) to nonlinear, passive UHF RFID backscatter transponders using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) base station. The proposed method does not require on-tag power measurements or on-tag channel estimation, either of which would add significant complexity and power consumption for microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices such as passive UHF RFID tags. We show in a measurement-based proof of concept that WPT optimization to nonlinear backscatter transponders is possible solely based on the backscatter signal, without knowledge of the incident power level at the tag or prior knowledge of the tag's characteristics. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery, we observed an average WPT enhancement of 8.9 dB relative to an un-optimized 8-transmitter configuration across a 50m3 volume in an office/lab environment. We also show that power to a given tag can be selectively denied, with a notch depth of -106.4 dB (noise floor of the presented measurements). These results are comparable to values previously observed for linear backscatter transponders, and suggest that the use of MIMO interrogators could lead to improved forward-link performance and thus efficiently provide power for sensors or other new power-hungry functions on passive transponders. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {A Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system comprises a very large number of distributed access points (APs), which simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users over the same time/frequency resources based on directly measured channel characteristics. The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max-min power control algorithms. Max-min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95%-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation. Under uncorrelated shadow fading conditions, the cell-free scheme provides nearly fivefold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over the small-cell scheme, and tenfold improvement when shadow fading is correlated.},

In that way, more than one carrier transmitters can be distributed in a given geographical area and illuminate a set of RF tags/sensors that modulate and scatter the received carrier towards a single software-defined receiver. The increased number of carrier transmitters and their distributed nature assists tags to be potentially located closer to one carrier transmitter and thus, improves the power of the scattered signals towards the receiver. Specifically, this work a) carefully derives near-optimal detectors for bi-static backscatter radio and on/off keying (OOK) tag modulation (which is widely used in commercial tags), b) analytically calculates their bit error rate (BER) performance, and c) experimentally tests them in practice with a custom bistatic backscatter radio link. As a collateral dividend, it is shown that the non-linear processing of the proposed receivers requires certain attention on the utilized tag design principles, commonly overlooked in the literature, validating recently reported theoretical results on the microwave domain. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to wirelessly connect billions of low-complexity devices. For wireless information transfer (IT) in IoT, high density of IoT devices and their ad hoc communication result in strong interference, which acts as a bottleneck on wireless IT. Furthermore, battery replacement for the massive number of IoT devices is difficult if not infeasible, making wireless energy transfer (ET) desirable. This motivates: 1) the design of full-duplex wireless IT to reduce latency and enable efficient spectrum utilization and 2) the implementation of passive IoT devices using backscatter antennas that enable wireless ET from one device (reader) to another (tag). However, the resultant increase in the density of simultaneous links exacerbates the interference issue. This issue is addressed in this paper by proposing the design of full-duplex backscatter communication (BackCom) networks, where a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum is designed to enable both one-way wireless ET and two-way wireless IT in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. Comprehensive performance analysis of BackCom networks is presented in this paper, including forward/backward bit-error rates and wireless ET efficiency and outage probabilities, which accounts for energy harvesting at tags, non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, respectively, and the effects of asynchronous transmissions.},

This survey presents an insightful understanding of 6G wireless communications by introducing requirements, features, critical technologies, challenges, and applications.

Subsequently, we introduce various 6G technologies and their existing challenges in detail, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent surfaces, THz, space-air-ground-sea integrated network, cell-free massive MIMO, etc. Because of these technologies, 6G is expected to outperform existing wireless communication systems regarding the transmission rate, latency, global coverage, etc. Next, we discuss security and privacy techniques that can be applied to protect data in 6G. Since edge devices are expected to gain popularity soon, the vast amount of generated data and frequent data exchange make the leakage of data easily. Finally, we predict real-world applications built on the technologies and features of 6G; for example, smart healthcare, smart city, and smart manufacturing will be implemented by taking advantage of AI.},

   abstract = {We present BackFi, a novel communication system that enables high throughput, long range communication between very low power backscatter devices and WiFi APs using ambient WiFi transmissions as the excitation signal. Specifically, we show that it is possible to design devices and WiFi APs such that the WiFi AP in the process of transmitting data to normal WiFi clients can decode backscatter signals which the devices generate by modulating information on to the ambient WiFi transmission. We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25]. BackFi design is energy efficient, as it relies on backscattering alone and needs insignificant power, hence the energy consumed per bit is small.},

   abstract = {Today's mobile devices contain sensitive data, which raises concerns about data security. This paper discusses a covert channel threat on existing mobile systems. Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

Therefore, it has been considered as a promising candidate for the future Internet-of-Things with stringent energy and spectrum constraints. In this paper, we investigate a full-duplex-enabled cognitive backscatter network, in which an AmBC system underlays a primary cellular system, and the primary access point can transmit primary signals and receive backscatter signals simultaneously via full-duplex communications. We aim to maximize the throughput of the AmBC system while guaranteeing the minimum rate requirements of the primary system via joint time scheduling, transmit power allocation, and reflection coefficient (RC) adjustment. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative method utilizing block coordinated decent to partition the variables into the time scheduling variable and the joint transmit power allocation and RC adjustment variable. For the time scheduling problem, we first prove its convexity and then utilize the interior-point method to solve it. For the joint power allocation and RC adjustment problem, we resort to the concave-convex procedure to transform it into a sequence of convex optimization problems, and then adopt Lagrange dual decomposition to tackle these convex optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the throughput of the AmBC system with a fast convergence speed.},

   abstract = {In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, KMN +KM channel coefficients should be estimated, where K, N and M denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting elements, and antennas at the base station (BS), respectively. These numbers can be extremely large in practice considering the current trend of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), i.e., a large M, and massive connectivity, i.e., a large K. To accurately estimate such a large number of channel coefficients within a short time interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation framework in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications, in which the direct channels from the users to the BS, the IRS reflected channels of a typical user, and the IRS reflected channels of the other users are estimated in three consecutive phases, respectively. Under this framework, we analytically prove that a time duration consisting of K + N + max(K .. 1; d(K .. 1)N=Me) pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover all the KMN + KM channel coefficients for the case without receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for conventional uplink communications without IRS where the minimum channel estimation time is independent of the number of receive antennas at the BS, our result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted communications. Further, for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form, and the corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.},

In this paper, we address this issue and derive communication models by using rigorous scattering parameter network analysis.

In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an IRS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of IRS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.},

In this study, we evaluate the performance of an LIS-assisted large-scale antenna system by formulating a tight approximation of the ergodic capacity and investigate the effect of the phase shifts on the ergodic capacity in different propagation scenarios. In particular, we propose an optimal phase shift design based on the ergodic capacity approximation and statistical channel state information. Furthermore, we derive the requirement on the quantization bits of the LIS to promise an acceptable capacity degradation. Numerical results show that using the proposed phase shift design can achieve the maximum ergodic capacity, and a 2-bit quantizer is sufficient to ensure capacity degradation of no more than 1 bit/s/Hz.},

The vehicle's high Doppler frequency results in a fast fading channel between the BS and the passenger/user, which renders channel estimation for the IRS with a large number of refracting elements a more challenging task as compared to the conventional case with low-mobility users only. In order to mitigate the Doppler effect and reap the full IRS passive beamforming gain with low training overhead, we propose a new and efficient transmission protocol to execute channel estimation and IRS refraction design for data transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the IRS and user both moving at the same high speed, we first estimate the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel with the Doppler effect compensated. Then, we estimate the instantaneous BS-user fast fading channel (without IRS refraction) and tune the IRS refraction over time accordingly to align the cascaded channel with the BS-user direct channel, thus maximizing the IRS's passive beamforming gain as well as converting their combined channel from fast to slow fading. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and passive beamforming design as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

The main issue is to keep the probability of each user's achievable rate outage as caused by CSI uncertainties below a given threshold. As is well known, such rate outage constraints present a significant analytical and computational challenge. Indeed, they do not admit simple closed-form expressions and are unlikely to be efficiently computable in general. Assuming Gaussian CSI uncertainties, we first review a traditional robust optimization-based method for approximating the rate outage constraints, and then develop two novel approximation methods using probabilistic techniques. Interestingly, these three methods can be viewed as implementing different tractable analytic upper bounds on the tail probability of a complex Gaussian quadratic form, and they provide convex restrictions, or safe tractable approximations, of the original rate outage constraints. In particular, a feasible solution from any one of these methods will automatically satisfy the rate outage constraints, and all three methods involve convex conic programs that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf solvers. We then proceed to study the performance-complexity tradeoffs of these methods through computational complexity and comparative approximation performance analyses. Finally, simulation results are provided to benchmark the three convex restriction methods against the state of the art in the literature. The results show that all three methods offer significantly improved solution quality and much lower complexity.},

In this paper, we show that a linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can efficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver architecture. By splitting the unicast message into common and private parts and encoding the common parts along with the multicast message into a super-common stream decoded by all users, the SIC is used for the dual purpose of separating the unicast and multicast streams as well as better managing the multi-user interference between the unicast streams. The precoders are designed with the objective of maximizing the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of the unicast messages subject to a Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of the multicast message and a sum power constraint. Numerical results show that RS outperforms existing Multi-User Linear-Precoding (MU-LP) and power-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in a wide range of user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions and channel strengths). Moreover, since one layer of SIC is required to separate the unicast and multicast streams, the performance gain of RS comes without any increase in the receiver complexity compared with MU-LP. Hence, in such non-orthogonal unicast and multicast transmissions, RS provides rate and QoS enhancements at no extra cost for the receivers.},

   abstract = {The past decade has seen many advances in physical layer wireless communication theory and their implementation in wireless systems. This textbook takes a unified view of the fundamentals of wireless communication and explains the web of concepts underpinning these advances at a level accessible to an audience with a basic background in probability and digital communication. Topics covered include MIMO (multi-input, multi-output) communication, space-time coding, opportunistic communication, OFDM and CDMA. The concepts are illustrated using many examples from real wireless systems such as GSM, IS-95 (CDMA), IS-856 (1 x EV-DO), Flash OFDM and UWB (ultra-wideband). Particular emphasis is placed on the interplay between concepts and their implementation in real systems. An abundant supply of exercises and figures reinforce the material in the text. This book is intended for use on graduate courses in electrical and computer engineering and will also be of great interest to practising engineers.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we exploit the radio diversity gain in a multi-user hybrid radio network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each user has a dual-mode radio that can switch between the passive and active modes, according to the channel and energy conditions. This provides extra degree of freedom to improve the overall network performance. As such, we propose a throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing the PBS' energy beamforming and the radios' transmission scheduling strategies in two modes. We show that the throughput maximization is easily tractable by solving a semi-definite program. However, it becomes non-convex and intractable when we allow radios' cooperation in data transmissions. To this end, we propose a set of heuristic algorithms with different complexities for cooperative relay transmissions, which are shown to significantly improve the sum throughput compared to the non-cooperative case. The simulation results show that a simple adaptive scheme can achieve the maximum throughput according to the PBS' power supply.},

Backscatter communication systems, on the other hand, modulate an antenna’s impedance to encode information into already existing waves but suffer from low data rates and a lack of information security. Here, we introduce the concept of massive backscatter communication which modulates the propagation environment of stray ambient waves with a programmable metasurface. The metasurface’s large aperture and huge number of degrees of freedom enable unprecedented wave control and thereby secure and high-speed information transfer. Our prototype leveraging existing commodity 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals achieves data rates on the order of hundreds of Kbps. Our technique is applicable to all types of wave phenomena and provides a fundamentally new perspective on the role of metasurfaces in future wireless communication.},

A two-dimensional array of optical resonators with spatially varying phase response and subwavelength separation can imprint such phase discontinuities on propagating light as it traverses the interface between two media. Anomalous reflection and refraction phenomena are observed in this regime in optically thin arrays of metallic antennas on silicon with a linear phase variation along the interface, which are in excellent agreement with generalized laws derived from Fermat’s principle.

We first aim to maximize the system's sum rate, which requires selecting the appropriate subcarriers for each user and distribute the transmission power. The formulated non-convex problem is transformed into a convex one, and further, an optimal and low-complexity iterative water-filling solution is proposed. Nonetheless, it is shown that maximum transmit power is employed by each user to maximize the sum rate. Motivated by the fact that the users are power constrained, the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is also studied. Based on fractional programming, the EE maximization problem is transformed into a series of sum rate maximization subproblems, and the proposed iterative water-filling solution is applied to each subproblem. The proposed schemes are compared with other NOMA-based and orthogonal multiple access based algorithms, and its superiority is fully validated.},

To facilitate efficient system design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all the IRS elements, we partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization framework comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. In the offline stage, the IRS elements of each tile are jointly designed to support a set of different phase shift configurations, referred to as transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set for each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to minimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which entails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power savings compared to several baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission modes, the proposed scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large IRSs.},

Then, an IRS enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system is investigated. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. With the aid of the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be solved by classic block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Complexity and convergence for both cases are analyzed or illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement compared to that achieved using the ideal reflection model, which confirms the importance of the use of the practical model for the design of wideband systems.},

In this paper, the concept of active RISs is proposed to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike the existing passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals. We develop a signal model for active RISs, which is validated through experimental measurements. Based on this model, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for active RIS aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and a precoding algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Results show that, in a typical wireless system, the existing passive RISs can realize only a negligible sum-rate gain of 3\%, while the proposed active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 108\%, thus overcoming the multiplicative fading effect.},

We observe that the coverage probability decreases with an increase in the density of the BNs, while the capacity of the network improves. We further compare the performance of this network with a regular powered network in which the BNs have a reliable power source and show that for a very high density of the PBs, the coverage probability of the former network approaches that of the regular powered network.},

Considering the nonlinearity of practical energy harvesting circuits, we adopt the realistic nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the optimal rate-energy (RE) tradeoff, we consider the problem of maximizing the R-E region, which is nonconvex. We solve this challenging problem for two different cases of the channel state information (CSI): (i) when the CSI is known only at the receiver (the CSIR case) and (ii) when the CSI is known at both the transmitter and the receiver (the CSI case). For these two cases, we develop the corresponding optimal dynamic power splitting schemes. To address the complexity issue, we also propose the suboptimal schemes with low complexities. Comparing the proposed schemes to the existing schemes, we provide various useful and interesting insights into the dynamic power splitting for the nonlinear EH. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the scenarios of the partial CSI at the transmitter and the harvested energy maximization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the existing schemes and the proposed suboptimal scheme works very close to the optimal scheme at a much lower complexity.},

   abstract = {Backscatter communication (BSC) is being realized as the core technology for pervasive sustainable Internet-of-Things applications. However, owing to the resource-limitations of passive tags, the efficient usage of multiple antennas at the reader is essential for both downlink excitation and uplink detection. This work targets at maximizing the achievable sum-backscattered-throughput by jointly optimizing the transceiver (TRX) design at the reader and backscattering coefficients (BC) at the tags. Since, this joint problem is nonconvex, we first present individually-optimal designs for the TRX and BC. We show that with precoder and combiner designs at the reader respectively targeting downlink energy beamforming and uplink Wiener filtering operations, the BC optimization at tags can be reduced to a binary power control problem. Next, the asymptotically-optimal joint-TRX-BC designs are proposed for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regimes. Based on these developments, an iterative low-complexity algorithm is proposed to yield an efficient jointly-suboptimal design. Thereafter, we discuss the practical utility of the proposed designs to other application settings like wireless powered communication networks and BSC with imperfect channel state information. Lastly, selected numerical results, validating the analysis and shedding novel insights, demonstrate that the proposed designs can yield significant enhancement in the sum-backscattered throughput over existing benchmarks.},

   abstract = {We consider a monostatic wireless powered backscatter communication (WPBC) system, where a device performs backscatter modulation and energy harvesting (EH) using the received signal from a multi-antenna hybrid access point. The rate-energy regions of the WPBC are studied for power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receivers in a comprehensive way by using the rate and EH functions reflecting the effects of practical systems. For both linear and nonlinear EH models, we analyze the rate-energy regions of the static PS and TS strategies and optimize the dynamic strategies exploiting the channel state information (CSI) to extend the regions. The regions with the static strategies are obtained in closed-form expressions and the dynamic strategies are obtained in explicit forms as a function of a dual variable, by approximating the nonlinear EH model to a piecewise linear EH (PLEH) model. The results show that the dynamic PS and TS strategies outperform their static counterparts and their gains are more prominent in the sensitivity region of a nonlinear EH circuit and with a smaller number of antennas. It is also observed that the dynamic PS strategy provides the best performance but can be replaced by the static one for a large number of antennas to avoid the CSI. The strategies obtained explicitly by using the PLEH model are also shown to work well with a practical EH model without a noticeable loss in the performance.},

   abstract = {This work studies both limited sensitivity and non-linearity of far field RF energy harvesting observed in reality and quantifies their effect, attempting to fill a major hole in the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) literature. RF harvested power is modeled as an arbitrary nonlinear, continuous, and non-decreasing function of received power, taking into account limited sensitivity and saturation effects. RF harvester's sensitivity may be several dBs worse than communications receiver's sensitivity, potentially rendering RF information signals useless for energy harvesting purposes. Given finite number of datapoint pairs of harvested (output) power and corresponding input power, a piecewise linear approximation is applied and the statistics of the harvested power are offered, as a function of the wireless channel fading statistics. Limited number of datapoints are needed and accuracy analysis is also provided. Case studies include duty-cycled (non-continuous), as well as continuous SWIPT, comparing with industry-level, RF harvesting. The proposed approximation, even though simple, offers accurate performance for all studied metrics. On the other hand, linear models or nonlinear-unlimited sensitivity harvesting models deviate from reality, especially in the low-input-power regime. The proposed methodology can be utilized in current and future SWIPT research.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the problem of joint mode switching and power adaptation is studied for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) over a fading channel. The receiver dynamically switches between information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) modes while the transmitter dynamically adapts the transmit power. Considering the nonlinearity of practical EH circuits, a realistic nonlinear EH model is adopted rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the ultimate performance tradeoff between ID and EH, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average harvested energy under the constraints on the average achievable rate and the average transmit power, which is a nonconvex and combinatorial problem. To solve this problem, first, the optimal power adaptation scheme for the nonlinear EH receiver that operates only in the EH mode is proposed. Using this scheme, the jointly optimal solution for the mode switching and power adaptation is then derived. By comparing the obtained results to the existing results, various useful and interesting insights into the optimized SWIPT system with nonlinear EH are presented. An important insight into the impact of nonlinear EH is that, to exploit the high energy conversion efficiency of the nonlinear circuit, the EH mode has to be selected only in the moderate range of channel gains. Also, in the EH mode, the power has to be adapted to the short-term power threshold only for the moderate channel gains.},

The SPs design their precoders as virtualization demands for user services, while the InP designs the actual precoding solution to meet the service demands from the SPs. Our aim is to minimize the long-term time-averaged expected precoding deviation over MIMO fading channels, subject to both per-cell long-term and short-term transmit power limits. We propose an online coordinated precoding algorithm for virtualization, which provides a fully distributed semi-closed-form precoding solution at each cell, based only on the current imperfect CSI without any CSI exchange across cells. Taking into account the two-fold impact of imperfect CSI on both the InP and the SPs, we show that our proposed algorithm is within an $O(\delta)$ gap from the optimum over any time horizon, where $\delta$ is a CSI inaccuracy indicator. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm under two commonly used precoding techniques in a typical urban micro-cell network environment.},

Contrary to the conventional linear precoding (NoRS) that relies on fully treating any residual interference as noise, we consider a novel multigroup multicast beamforming strategy based on RSMA. RSMA relies on linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, and has recently been shown to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference management in multi-antenna wireless networks. In this work, we characterize the MMF Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) achieved by RS and NoRS in multigroup multicast with imperfect CSIT and demonstrate the benefits of RS strategies for both underloaded and overloaded scenarios. Motivated by the DoF analysis, we then formulate a generic transmit power constrained optimization problem to achieve MMF rate performance. The superiority of RS-based multigroup multicast beamforming compared with NoRS is demonstrated via simulations in both terrestrial and multibeam satellite systems. In particular, due to the characteristics and challenges of multibeam satellite communications, our proposed RS strategy is shown promising to manage its inter-beam interference.},

We explicitly focus on overloaded scenarios in which the number of transmitting antennas is insufficient to neutralize all inter-group interference. Such scenarios are becoming increasingly relevant in the light of growing lowlatency content delivery demands, and also commonly appear in multibeam satellite systems. We derive performance limits of classical beamforming strategies using DoF analysis unveiling their limitations; for example, rates saturate in overloaded scenarios due to inter-group interference. To tackle interference, we propose a strategy based on degraded beamforming and successive interference cancellation. While the degraded strategy resolves the rate-saturation issue, this comes at a price of sacrificing all spatial multiplexing gains. This motivates the development of a unifying strategy that combines the benefits of the two previous strategies. We propose a beamforming strategy based on rate-splitting (RS) which divides the messages intended to each group into a degraded part and a designated part, and transmits a superposition of both degraded and designated beamformed streams. The superiority of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through DoF analysis. Finally, we solve the RS beamforming design problem and demonstrate significant performance gains through simulations.},

However, the performance of AirComp is bottlenecked by the worst channel condition among all links between the IoT devices and the access point. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted AirComp system is proposed to boost the received signal power and thus mitigate the performance bottleneck by reconfiguring the propagation channels. With an objective to minimize the AirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS phase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex programming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization framework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique, which is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth convex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a Mirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates. Simulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving a similar distortion performance.},

In particular, the message intended to one of the users is split into two parts: a common part which can be recovered by all users, and a private part recovered by the corresponding user. On the other hand, the rest of users receive their information through private messages. This rate-splitting (RS) approach was shown to boost the achievable degrees of freedom when CSIT errors decay with increased SNR. In this paper, the RS strategy is married with linear precoder design and optimization techniques to achieve a maximized ergodic SR (ESR) performance over the entire range of SNRs. Precoders are designed based on partial CSIT knowledge by solving a stochastic rate optimization problem using means of sample average approximation coupled with the weighted minimum mean square error approach. Numerical results show that in addition to the ESR gains, the benefits of RS also include relaxed CSIT quality requirements and enhanced achievable rate regions compared with conventional transmission with no rate-splitting.},

   abstract = {—In this paper, we are interested in symbiotic radio networks, in which an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network parasitizes in a primary network to achieve spectrum-, energy-, and infrastructure-efficient communications. Specifically, the BS serves multiple cellular users using time division multiple access (TDMA) and each IoT device is associated with one cellular user for information transmission. We focus on the user association problem, whose objective is to link each IoT device to an appropriate cellular user by maximizing the sum rate of all IoT devices. However, the difficulty in obtaining the full real-time channel information makes it difficult to design an optimal policy for this problem. To overcome this issue, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, both use the historical information to infer the current information in order to make appropriate decisions. One algorithm, centralized DRL, makes decisions for all IoT devices at one time with global information. The other algorithm, distributed DRL, makes a decision only for one IoT device at one time using local information. Finally, simulation results show that the two DRL algorithms achieve comparable performance as the optimal user association policy which requires perfect real-time information, and the distributed DRL algorithm has the advantage of scalability.},

The problem can be formulated as maximizing the mutual information given the energy level and the power constraint for achieving a so-called rate-energy region. The formulated problem is non-concave, which can be reduced to a convex power allocation problem by the proposed gradient-descend design of the precoding matrix. Several rate-energy regions can be achieved by trading off between the information rate and the harvested energy with different schemes.

To maximize the system throughput and ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the backscatter time and reflection coefficients of the BDs, and the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs' harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. However, the formulated problem is non-trivial to solve in general, since the variables are mutually coupled and result in non-convex constraints. We thus propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization techniques. We further show the convergence performances of the proposed algorithm and analyze its complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed joint design achieves significant throughput gain as compared to the benchmark schemes.},

While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limitedto short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscattersystem. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m,while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RFsource, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800ft2(446m2) house spread across threefloors, a 13,024ft2(1210m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046m2) vegetable farm and show that wecan achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as aflexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a3,328ft2(309m2) room.

We develop a backscattering tag-to-tag network (BTTN), comprised of passive tags capable of large-scale, passive, and multihop communication with each other via backscatter modulation of an external RF excitation signal. The low sensitivity and lack of active demodulator on passive tags present significant challenges to the communication, including a unique phase cancellation problem, which significantly affects the range and robustness of a passive tag-to-tag link. We overcome these challenges using innovative tag architecture and also develop a novel multiphase backscatter modulation technique with a learning mechanism that overcomes the phase cancellation problem. This improves the link performance bringing passive tag-to-tag communication closer to practical use. The additional hardware compared to the conventional radio frequency identification tag architecture includes one more terminating impedance in the modulator. The data rate is reduced due to backscatter at two different phases while the increase in the power consumption is negligible. We develop prototype BTTN tag hardware and firmware and evaluate its performance. The prototype achieves link ranges of up to 3 m at 5 kb/s with an excitation power level of only-20 dBm while successfully overcoming phase cancellation. We further extend BTTN operation to a multihop network where we demonstrate a four hop link capable of communicating over 12 m under similar conditions.},

The ultra-low-power backscatter communications (BackCom) with the inherent feature of RF energy harvesting is a promising technology for tackling this challenge. Moreover, many future IoT applications will require the deployment of dense IoT devices, which induces strong interference for wireless information transfer (IT). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose the design of a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) to simultaneously suppress interference and enable both two-way wireless IT and one-way wireless energy transfer (ET) in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. The performance analysis of the BackCom network is presented, including the bit-error rates for forward and backward IT and the expected energy-transfer rate for forward ET, which account for non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, and energy harvesting at tags, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between energy harvesting and interference performance. Thus, system parameters need to be chosen carefully to satisfy given BackCom system performance requirement.},

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communications have emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable development of the Internet of Things (IoT). In such system, a radio frequency (RF) tag can transmit data to a receiver without battery and without generating any new RF wave, just by backscattering the incident RF wave originated by an ambient RF source. The simplest tag is a dipole that is either in an absorbing mode or in reflecting mode to send "0" or "1", and thus leads to a modulation order of 2. Previous solutions to reach higher modulation order, so as to achieve higher data rate, are based on antenna arrays. However, such solutions are not suitable for connected objects, due to their sizes. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a new tag that uses a compact antenna with reconfigurable radiation patterns to provide a high modulation order. We present experimental bit error rate measurements obtained with an experimental test-bed and two tag antennas, both providing 4 states and thus being able to convey 2 bits per symbol. These measurements show that the performance improves with increasing number of receive antennas, and lead to the conclusion that a tag antenna with low cross-correlations between reconfigurable radiation patterns is suitable for backscattering applications in IoT.},

   abstract = {This work offers both analog and digital tag modulation schemes and respective receiver designs, for ultra-low power, high performance, ambient backscatter communications. All proposed techniques are based on simple, but careful, switching frequency control at the tag, allowing for the easy frequency-domain multiple access. First, a digital modulation scheme is offered, namely pseudo-frequency shift keying, assuming illumination from constant envelope-modulated signals and a fully coherent detector is derived along with closed-form probability of error. A second digital modulation scheme is also offered, based on a frequency-shifted form of binary phase shift keying (S-BPSK), relaxing the constant-envelope requirement for the illuminator and an illumination-agnostic detector is derived. Based on S-BPSK, short packet error correction coding is utilized for ambient backscatter communication, for the first time in the literature. It is shown that the proposed coded scheme under modulated ambient signal illumination & wireless channel variation, offers tremendous performance gains, i.e., modulation of the ambient signal is helpful. Finally, a third, purely analog, modulation scheme is analyzed, based on FM remodulation principles. A low-cost tag is implemented, demonstrating tag-toreceiver ranges up to 26 meters outdoors, power consumption of 24 μWatts in continuous operation, able to be interrogated by any conventional frequency modulation (FM) receiver.

The interaction mechanism between the reader and the tag is described in a physically meaningful way by the reciprocity theorem which is deeply rooted into Maxwell equations. This approach provides a simple and yet complete formulation that allows to fully describe the interaction between the reader and the tag, even in complex environments. From this formulation, a clear understanding is derived on how the different design tradeoffs affect system performance. Based on this approach, the paper is focused on several issues of practical relevance for antenna tag design such as maximum power transfer, maximum sensitivity, and nonlinearity effects. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {A touchstone for selecting two scattering states for scalar differential backscattering in passive scatterers was introduced by Green in 1963. According to this model, a scatterer has one global minimum and one global maximum scattering states on its Γ plane. The variation of radar cross section (RCS) of the scatterer between these two states is monotonic. Thus, to achieve to the highest differential backscattering the scatterer should switch between these two states. In this paper, we verify, by measurements and simulations, that a linear half-wave dipole antenna behaves as predicted by the Green model. However, we show that the RCS of a T-match bow tie antenna over its Γ plane cannot be modeled by the Green model and instead the antenna has two maximum scattering states on its Γ plane. In the next step, we use dual loading on the T-match bowtie antenna structure. By appropriate selection of the loads, the antenna can provide various scattering states with various magnitudes in 360° phase span in its in-phase and quadrature plane. This feature of the proposed antenna can be used to increase the modulation depth up to 170%, provide a quasi-32-quasi-quadrature amplitude shift keying, and increase the coverage range in backscattering links.},

   abstract = {Piezo-acoustic bacskcatter (PAB) is a recently-introduced ultra-low-power underwater communication technology. In contrast to traditional underwater acoustic modems, which need to generate power-consuming carrier signals, PAB nodes communicate by simply reflecting (i.e., backscattering) existing acoustic signals in the environment. This reflection-based approach enables them to communicate at net-zero power but also imposes significant constraints on their throughput and modulation schemes. We present PAB-QAM, the first underwater backscatter design capable of achieving higher-order modulation. PAB-QAM exploits the electro-mechanical coupling property of piezoelectric transducers to modulate their reflection coefficients. Specifically, by strategically employing reactive circuit components (inductors), we demonstrate how PAB-QAM nodes can modulate the phase and amplitude of acoustic reflections and realize higher-order and spectrally-efficient modulation schemes such as QAM. We designed and built a prototype of PAB-QAM and empirically evaluated it underwater. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that PAB-QAM can double the throughput of underwater backscatter without requiring additional power, spectrum, or cost. Looking ahead, such increased throughput paves way for various subsea IoT applications in ocean exploration, underwater climate monitoring, and marine life sensing.},

These surfaces consist of many passive elements of metamaterials whose impedance can be controllable to change the characteristics of wireless signals impinging on them. Channel estimation is a critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we propose novel channel estimation schemes for different RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The proposed methods exploit spatial correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed. For the RIS-assisted massive MIMO, a new receive combining method and a fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control optimally, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are studied to gain insight about which RIS configuration is preferable and when the channel estimation is necessary to boost the spectral efficiency.},

In this paper, we introduce hybrid device-to-device (D2D) communications by integrating ambient backscattering and wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and backscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient transmitters, on the hybrid D2D communications performance. Extensive simulations show that the repulsion factor among the ambient transmitters has a non-trivial impact on the communication performance. Additionally, we reveal how different mode selection protocols affect the performance metrics.},

Existing techniques for channel estimation are prohibitively complex and consume too much power to be integrated into milliwatt- or microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices. We show that power transfer can be optimized using a transponder's backscatter signal alone, without requiring channel estimation and power measurement circuitry on the transponder. A measurement-based proof of concept is presented, illustrating that for any linear backscatter transponder, power optimization based on the backscattered signal is equivalent to local measurement at the mobile device itself. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery across 100 randomly chosen locations in our office environment, we observe an average WPT enhancement of 8.1 dB relative to an unoptimized transmitter configuration. Transponders with nonlinear power harvesters can easily be supported with the addition of a single RF switching transistor. © 2002-2011 IEEE.},

The primary transmitter communicates with the IR and at the same time assists the IRS in forwarding information to the IR. Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.},

However, no effort have been made to design an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm with Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, and this observation motivates our work. In this paper, we consider a classical bistatic backscatter system, where the backscatter node first harvests energy from the dedicated power source in the sleep phase, then backscatters its information to the receiver and harvests energy simultaneously through a reflection coefficient in the active phase. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable energy efficiency, subject to the energy causality and QoS requirement, by optimizing the transmit power at the dedicated power source, the reflection coefficient, the time for sleep phase and active phase. As the formulated problem is a non-convex fractional programming problem and hard to solve, by means of the fractional programming, we firstly transform it in the fractional form as an equivalent problem in the subtractive form. By introducing several auxiliary variables and employing the monotonicity of the objective function, we show that the transformed problem can be reduced to one of the following two convex problems corresponding to two scenarios, i.e., the transmitter always operates in the active state and the dedicated power source adopts the maximum allowed power. Simulation results are provided to verify our findings and show the advantage of the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency.},

Based on the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures, two operating schemes are employed to enable energy harvesting and ambient backscattering at the ambient backscatter (AB) transmitter. In order to maximize the outage capacity for the AB transmitters, we formulate two optimization problems optimizing the TS and PS ratios. Two schemes with low complexity are proposed to obtain the near-optimal outage performance. Considering the coexistence of the AmBackComs and cellular downlink transmissions, successful transmission probabilities for AB transmitters and cellular downlink transmissions are both derived for the TS and PS schemes and provide insights on how various system parameters, such as the TS ratio, the PS ratio, the density of base stations (BSs)/AB transmitters, etc., impact the system performance. Numerical results show that the outage capacity for AmBackComs can be significantly improved by selecting a proper TS/PS ratio and our proposed schemes can achieve near-optimal outage capacities. The study also shows that many more ultra-low-power devices users can be connected via the proposed scheme at a cost of a slightly reduced overall network capacity.},

   abstract = {The integration of wireless power transfer (WPT) with the low-power backscatter communications provides a promising way to sustain battery-less wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a backscatter communication network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each backscatter radio uses the harvested energy to power its data transmissions, in which some other radios can help as the wireless relays with an aim to improve throughput performance by cooperative transmission. Under this setting, we formulate a throughput maximization problem to jointly optimize WPT and the relay strategy of the backscatter radios. An iterative algorithm with reduced complexity and communication overhead is proposed to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems distributed at the PBS and the backscatter receiver. Moreover, we take uncertain channel information into consideration and formulate robust counter-parts of the throughput maximization problem when either the backscatter or relay channel is subject to estimation errors. The difficulty of the robust counter-part lies in the coupling of the PBS' power allocation and relay strategy in matrix inequalities, which is addressed by alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results reveal that the cooperative relay strategy of the backscatter radios significantly improves the throughput performance.},

   abstract = {We present a method for estimating conditionally Gaussian random vectors with random covariance matrices, which uses techniques from the field of machine learning. Such models are typical in communication systems, where the covariance matrix of the channel vector depends on random parameters, e.g., angles of propagation paths. If the covariance matrices exhibit certain Toeplitz and shift-invariance structures, the complexity of the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator can be reduced to O(M\log M) floating point operations, where M is the channel dimension. While in the absence of structure the complexity is much higher, we obtain a similarly efficient (but suboptimal) estimator by using the MMSE estimator of the structured model as a blueprint for the architecture of a neural network. This network learns the MMSE estimator for the unstructured model, but only within the given class of estimators that contains the MMSE estimator for the structured model. Numerical simulations with typical spatial channel models demonstrate the generalization properties of the chosen class of estimators to realistic channel models.},

   abstract = {The newly emerging wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) have recently drawn significant attention, where radio signals are used to power wireless terminals for information transmission. In this paper, we study a WPCN where one multi-antenna access point (AP) coordinates energy transfer and information transfer to/from a set of single-antenna users. A harvest-then-transmit protocol is assumed where the AP first broadcasts wireless power to all users via energy beamforming in the downlink (DL), and then, the users send their independent information to the AP simultaneously in the uplink (UL) using their harvested energy. To optimize the users' throughput and yet guarantee their rate fairness, we maximize the minimum throughput among all users by a joint design of the DL-UL time allocation, the DL energy beamforming, and the UL transmit power allocation, as well as receive beamforming. We solve this nonconvex problem optimally by two steps. First, we fix the DL-UL time allocation and obtain the optimal DL energy beamforming, UL power allocation, and receive beamforming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of all users. This problem is shown to be still nonconvex; however, we convert it equivalently to a spectral radius minimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by applying the alternating optimization based on the nonnegative matrix theory. Then, the optimal time allocation is found by a one-dimensional search to maximize the minimum rate of all users. Furthermore, two suboptimal designs of lower complexity are also proposed, and their throughput performance is compared against that of the optimal solution.},

The paper proposes and analyzes three protocols for maximizing the sum-Throughput; namely, the time-division with downlink data decoding protocol, hybrid power splitting/data decoding protocol, and backscatter-enabled combination protocol. The time-division protocol optimizes a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with a two-way communication link between the sensors and a hybrid access point. The hybrid protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase. The backscattered-enabled combination protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase and backscatter communication enabled sensors. Numerical results show that the hybrid and combination protocols deliver up to 14.5% and 30.5% increase in sum-Throughput, respectively, compared with the reference time-switching RF EH protocol in a dynamic environment. The findings are significant for the future widespread adoption of WPCN systems powered by RF energy sources in the real world by increasing the amount of harvested energy and system achievable data rate.},

Nevertheless, depending on the load, the energy harvesting mechanism is degraded in one of the impedance loads.

A compact design solution for the proposed mirror system on the HFS is presented. The HFS CTS antenna is located behind the blankets and views the plasma through the gap between two blanket modules. The viewing gap has been modified to dimensions 30×500 mm2 to optimize the CTS signal. A 1:1 mock-up of the HFS mirror system was built.

We use this duality result to evaluate the system capacity achievable in a cellular wireless network with multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas at each terminal. Some fundamental properties of the rate region are exhibited and algorithms for determining the optimal weighted rate sum and the optimal covariance matrices for achieving a given rate vector on the boundary of the rate region are presented. These algorithms are then used in a simulation study to determine potential capacity enhancements to a cellular system through known-interference cancellation. We study both the circuit data scenario in which each user requires a constant data rate in every frame and the packet data scenario in which users can be assigned a variable rate in each frame so as to maximize the long-term average throughput. In the case of circuit data, the outage probability as a function of the number of active users served at a given rate is determined through simulations. For the packet data case, long-term average throughputs that can be achieved using the proportionally fair scheduling algorithm are determined. We generalized the zero-forcing beamforming technique to the multiple receive antennas case and use this as the baseline for the packet data throughput evaluation.},

To this end, we adopt a physics-based IRS model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers. For handling the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we apply a penalty-based method, successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation to develop a computationally efficient algorithm which asymptotically converges to a locally optimal solution of the considered problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme enables considerable power savings compared to two baseline schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate that the advocated physics-based model and scalable optimization framework for large IRSs allows us to strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, which is vital for realizing large IRS-assisted communication systems.},

An IRS is deployed to enhance the performance of wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting phase shifts of each reflecting elements. To achieve its self-sustainability, the IRS needs to collect energy from energy station to support its control circuit operation. Our proposed policy for the considered WPSN is called IRS assisted harvest-then-transmit time switching, which is able to schedule the transmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy reflection modes. We study the achievable sum throughput of the proposed transmission policy and investigate a joint design of the transmission time slots, the power allocation, as well as the discrete phase shifts of the WET and WIT. This formulates the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is NP-hard and non-convex. We first relax it to one with continuous phase shifts, and then propose a two-step approach and decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. We solve the first sub-problem with respect to the phase shifts of the WIT in terms of closed-form expression. For the second sub-problem, we consider a special case without the circuit power of each sensor node, the Lagrange dual method and the KKT conditions are applied to derive the optimal closed-form transmission time slots, power allocation, and phase shift of the WET. Then we generalise the case with the circuit power of each sensor node, which can be solved via employing a semi-definite programming relaxation. The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the continuous values. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy and validate the beneficial role of the IRS in comparison to the benchmark schemes.},

Two different protocols such as CNOMA-SWIPT-PS and CNOMA-SWIPT-TS are proposed, by employing power-splitting (PS) and time-switching (TS) energy harvesting (EH) techniques, respectively. In the proposed protocols, a base station (BS) directly communicates with a NOMA near user, whereas the communication with a NOMA far user is performed with the assistance of an energy-constrained relay node. The relay node harvests energy from the transmitted signal by the BS, employing PS or TS EH technique. We investigate ergodic sum capacity and outage probability of the proposed protocols along with analytical derivations over Nakagami-m fading channels. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing strategy and conventional multiple access is demonstrated through analysis and simulation.},

In this work, we address the problem of finding globally optimal power allocation strategies for the downlink of a generic single-cell NOMA system including multiple NOMA clusters each operating in an isolated resource block. Each cluster includes a set of users in which the well-known superposition coding (SC) combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique (called SC-SIC) is applied among them. Interestingly, we prove that in both the sum-rate and energy efficiency maximization problems, network-NOMA can be equivalently transformed to a virtual network-OMA system, where the effective channel gain of these virtual OMA users are obtained in closed-form. Then, the latter problems are solved by using very fast water-filling and Dinkelbach algorithms, respectively. The equivalent transformation of NOMA to the virtual OMA system brings new insights, which are discussed throughout the paper. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the performance gap between fully SC-SIC, NOMA, and OMA in terms of system outage probability, BS's power consumption, users sum-rate, and system energy efficiency.},

First, a beamforming approach with perfect channel state information is investigated to provide the required quality of service for all users. Taylor series approximation and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques are employed to reformulate the original nonconvex power minimization problem to a tractable one. Furthermore, a fairness-based beamforming approach is proposed through a max-min formulation to maintain fairness between users. Next, we consider a robust scheme by incorporating channel uncertainties, where the transmit power is minimized while satisfying the outage probability requirement at each user. Through exploiting the SDR approach, the original nonconvex problem is reformulated in a linear matrix inequality form to obtain the optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the robust scheme can achieve better performance compared to the nonrobust scheme in terms of the rate satisfaction ratio. Furthermore, simulation results confirm that NOMA consumes a little over half transmit power needed by orthogonal multiple access for the same data rate requirements. Hence, NOMA has the potential to significantly improve the system performance in terms of transmit power consumption in future 5G networks and beyond.},

We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the access point (AP) and passive beamforming at the RIS under the assumption that the RIS's state information is statistically known by the AP, and propose a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization technique. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed scheme in Rician fading is derived. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is also investigated under the assumption that the transmitted symbols are drawn from a finite constellation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and reveal the effect of various system parameters on the achievable rate. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms, in terms of achievable rate, the conventional RIS-assisted system without information transfer.},

For each scheme, the optimal reflection coefficient or the optimal primary transmit power are derived and closed-form expressions of outage probability are then developed for both primary and backscatter systems. Also, asymptotic outage behavior is characterized in the high transmit signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our analysis shows that for the backscatter system, both parasitic and competitive schemes achieve the same outage probability which is irrelevant to the backscatter channels, whereas the commensal scheme can attain exactly the same asymptotic outage performance with the other two schemes at high transmit SNR. In addition, as the SNR threshold of the backscatter system approaches to zero, the three schemes can achieve the same outage performance for the backscatter system. Finally, the theoretical results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-Aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-Antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-Antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing a nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth objective function, ϕ(x, … , xp, y) , subject to coupled linear equality constraints. Our ADMM updates each of the primal variables x, … , xp, y, followed by updating the dual variable. We separate the variable y from xi’s as it has a special role in our analysis. The developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions such as piecewise linear functions, ℓq quasi-norm, Schatten-q quasi-norm (0 < q< 1), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. It also allows nonconvex constraints such as compact manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds) and linear complementarity constraints. Also, the x-block can be almost any lower semi-continuous function. By applying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM algorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning, optimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge. Our results provide sufficient conditions for ADMM to converge on (convex or nonconvex) monotropic programs with three or more blocks, as they are special cases of our model. ADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). We present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges with bounded penalty parameter β. Indicated by this example and other analysis in this paper, ADMM might be a better choice than ALM for some nonconvex nonsmooth problems, because ADMM is not only easier to implement, it is also more likely to converge for the concerned scenarios.},

In conventional power-domain NOMA, multiple users are multiplexed in the same time and frequency band by different preset power levels, which, however, may limit the spectral efficiency under practical finite alphabet inputs. Inspired by the concept of spatial modulation, we propose to solve this problem by encoding extra information bits into the power levels, and exploit different signal constellations to help the receiver distinguish between them. To convey this idea, termed power selection (PS)-NOMA, clearly, we consider a simple downlink two-user NOMA system with finite input constellations.

The passive relays backscatter the RF signals from the source to the receiver which, by experiments, shows to improve the transmission rate due to the enhanced multi-path diversity gain. We also introduce an optimization to quantify the performance improvement achievable by the radios' cooperation in the hybrid radio network.},

In this paper, we present RF energy harvesting circuit with three different approaches: resonator, number of multiplier stages and low pass filter (LPF). Resonator provide 30 times improvement in amplitude of input (100 mV) AC signal. In proposed circuit L type network, between input power source and rectifier, works as resonator as well as matching network at resonant frequency. It results in maximum efficiency 79% with 50kO load at -10 dBm input power. We also present the effect of multiplier stages on output voltage and RF to DC conversion efficiency. Optimum efficiency of approximately 80% is achieved with Dickson topology in input power region 0 to 10dBm for 3rd, 5th and 7th stages, respectively. Application of LPF is also introduced with an existing circuit. It provides 140 mV improvement in output voltage with input power -10dBm. It also shows that maximum efficiency 75% and 64% is possible with dielectric constant (er=9) and substrate height (H=0.0004m), for microstrip line of matching circuit at -10 dBm input power with 10 kO load. © 2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising technology that obtains energy from electromagnetic waves. As an alternative energy source, this modern technology can provide power wirelessly enabling the practical use of battery-free devices and it is also expected to be widely used in future applications. Many studies have examined the effects of different modulation techniques on power or efficiency in RF energy-harvesting systems. In this article, the effects of different modulation techniques, such as amplitude shift keying (ASK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and frequency shift keying (FSK) on charging time, were measured and theoretically analyzed in detail. The measurement system was designed using a signal generator, an RF energy-harvesting circuit, and other auxiliary devices. The signal generator produced four different modulated signals as transmit power signals from 1 to 10 dBm at the interval of 1 dBm, and then, the RF energy-harvesting circuit was fed with these power signals. According to the measurement results, four different modulation techniques charged the RF energy-harvesting circuit at different times. It was observed that the 4-ASK modulation technique had the shortest charging time in the range of 1-10 dBm when comparing to QAM, PSK, and FSK modulation techniques, and thus, it was evaluated to be the most suitable modulation technique for the RF energy-harvesting system among these modulation techniques in terms of charging time.},

   abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) -powered backscattering communication (BC) has many advantages such as low power consumption, battery-free, small size, low cost, full sealing, manual maintenance-free, and easy mass deployment. However, the weak RF energy harvested and the short BC distance have become the two critical obstacles in the real-world implementation of this potential technology. In this paper, we propose a high-sensitivity RF energy harvesting (RFEH) and long-distance BC method, and for the first time, we demonstrate the RF-powered self-sustainable long-distance BC device named RFEH LoRa. In order to improve RFEH sensitivity, an ultra-low power (ULP) consumption voltage monitoring and startup control circuit topology is designed to reduce the power consumption to 245 nanowatt (nW) during the accumulation of RF energy. While in order to increase the BC distance, a direct digital frequency synthesis (DDS) technology is used to generate a linear frequency modulation (LFM) square wave sequence conforming to the LoRa specifications based on the ULP microcontroller unit (MCU), and the square wave is used to drive an RF switch to achieve long-distance BC of hundreds of meters. Test results show that the instantaneous BC current is as low as 130 microampere (lA), and the standby current is only 52 nanoampere (nA). RFEH LoRa is implemented with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. It can self-startup by harvesting RF energy as low as.22.5 dBm, and send its sensing data to the receiver of 381 meters away.},

Two varactor diodes are used to achieve a tunable output power ratio P 2 : P 3 varying from 1 : 1 to 1 : 10 under good matching conditions. The SWIPT system that operates at 2.4 GHz consists of a typical patch antenna, cascaded with the tunable PS, and a voltage doubler rectifier. The constituent components were implemented and tested as stand-alone devices and were subsequently combined in a measurement system using interconnectors. The effect of the tunable PS was explored with respect to the SNR measurements on the port that is intended for the information decoding receiver and the DC voltage measurements on the termination load of the rectifier that is connected directly on the energy harvesting port of the tunable PS. A spectrum analyzer is used for the SNR measurements while the input power is controlled using a signal generator. Both wireless power transmission and on-board measurements verify that the harvested energy can be maximized by using the minimum SNR at the information decoding branch at the expense of DC power consumption required for the biasing of the varactor diodes.},

First, we established the RF energy harvesting model and gave the energy condition. In order to minimize the interference of subcarriers and increase the spectral efficiency, then, the colocated passive QAM backscatter communication signal model is presented and the nonlinear optimization problems of power control are solved for passive QAM backscatter communication systems. Solutions include maximum and minimum access interval, the maximum and minimum duty cycle, and the minimal RF-harvested energy under the energy condition for node operating. Using the solutions above, the maximum throughput of passive QAM backscatter communication systems is analyzed and numerical calculation is made finally. Numerical calculation shows that the maximal throughput decreases with the consumed power and the number of sensors, and the maximum throughput is decreased quickly with the increase of the number of sensors. Especially, for a given consumed power of sensor, it can be seen that the throughput decreases with the duty cycle and the number of sensors has little effect on the throughput.},

A proof-of-concept prototype is demonstrated in an indoor environment with the low bit rate of 345 b/s and power consumption 27μW. It operated using a real FM station at 34.5 km away and the tag-to-reader distance was tested at 1 m. The value of energy spent in this modulator was 78.2 nJ/bit at 345 b/s and 27.7 nJ/bit at 10.2 kb/s.},

To overcome this problem, energy harvesting offers a viable alternative to autonomously power IoT devices, resulting in a number of battery-less energy harvesting IoTs (or EH-IoTs) appearing in the market in recent years. Standards activities are also underway, which involve wireless protocol design suitable for EH-IoTs as well as testing procedures for various energy harvesting methods. Despite the early commercial and standards activities, IoT sensing, computing and communications under unpredictable power supply still face significant research challenges. This paper systematically surveys recent advances in EH-IoTs from several perspectives. First, it reviews the recent commercial developments for EH-IoT in terms of both products and services, followed by initial standards activities in this space. Then it surveys methods that enable the use of energy harvesting hardware as a proxy for conventional sensors to detect contexts in energy efficient manner. Next it reviews the advancements in efficient checkpointing and timekeeping for intermittently powered IoT devices. We also survey recent research in novel wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs, such as the applications of reinforcement learning to optimize power allocations on-the-fly under unpredictable energy productions, and packet-less IoT communications and backscatter communication techniques for energy impoverished environments. The paper is concluded with a discussion of future research directions.},

We will first introduce the basic concept of programmable metasurfaces, followed by the promising paradigm shift in future wireless communication systems enabled by programmable metasurfaces. In particular, we give an overview of the two prospective paradigms of applying programmable metasurfaces in wireless transceivers, namely, RF chain-free transmitter and space-down-conversion receiver, which both have great potential to simplify the architecture and reduce the hardware cost of future wireless transceivers. Furthermore, we present the design architectures, preliminary experimental results and main advantages of these new paradigms and discuss their potential opportunities and challenges toward ultra-massive 6G communications with low hardware complexity, low cost, and high energy efficiency.},

First, the method makes it possible to measure a chip's impedance in activation state, which requires large input power, not compatible with VNA measurements. Second, this method realizes a real-time measurement, which consists in impedance measurement as a function of time. Therefore, this real-time measurement makes it possible to detect and measure the impedance changes of an actual contactless smart card's integrated circuit during a load modulation communication at different powers. Finally, this real-time impedance measurement gives important information on chips' electrical characteristics that can be used to optimize near-field communication devices design in order to reduce the power losses within an RF identification tag.},

   abstract = {The increasing use of backscatter radio for pervasive Internet-of-Things systems as a low-power and low-cost communication scheme will result in dense deployments of tags that need to operate under bandwidth (BW) constraints. Typical backscatter tags and computational radio frequency (RF) identification systems are unnecessarily limited to modulating data with 'ON-OFF' switching front-ends, which leads to extensive spectrum occupancy, due to the rectangular pulses. This paper sets the foundations to overcome these limitations and proposes designs of RF front-ends that are capable of varying the tag reflection coefficient in a continuous way over time. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated to perform pulse shaping on the backscattered signals, which require significantly reduced BW. The principles presented in this paper will enable sophisticated tags to perform complex modulation schemes under BW constraints, while maintaining a very low RF front-end complexity, using a single nonlinear component such as a p-i-n diode or field-effect transistor. Migrating the idea of pulse shaping from complex power-demanding active radios to such minimal RF front-ends will complete backscatter radio as a communication scheme for simple RF tags and sensors in large-scale deployments. Each tag becomes a miniature software-defined radio that implements diverse communication schemes with increased spectral efficiency.},

Under this scheme, BDs are categorized into different clusters, and only one cluster is allowed to transmit in each time slot. Within each cluster, NOMA is adopted. The latter cluster can harvest energy from previous clusters using peer assistance. We maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the BS&#x2019;s power allocation, BDs&#x2019; power reflection coefficients and the time allocation under practical constraints. Particularly, a practical energy causality constraint is considered, and the effect of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) of NOMA is also studied. Numerical results show that the peer-assisted NOMA-plus-TDMA scheme achieves satisfactory throughput gain over conventional schemes. It is also shown that peer assistance does help in terms of improving the system throughput and fairness.},

Delivering both wireless information provision (WIP) and wireless energy provision (WEP) services in the RF band requires a holistic design of wireless information and energy provision (WIEP) for achieving energy self-sustainability in the next generation of wireless networks, such as 6G. However, most of the existing works studied the integrated WIEP performance by exploiting Gaussian distributed signals with the infinite alphabet, which cannot be realised in a practical communication system. Therefore, we investigate the WIEP performance by considering practical modulation schemes having finite alphabet in a well-known Nakagami-m wireless fading channel. Furthermore, we jointly optimise the transmit power allocation and the transmission switching threshold of a WIEP transmitter and the power splitting ratio of a WIEP receiver in order to maximise the attainable spectrum efficiency for WIP, while satisfying both the WEP requirement and the WIP reliability constraint. Numerical results are provided for characterising the rate-energy-reliability trade-off of different modulation schemes in various wireless fading conditions.},

Through the analysis based on the realistic nonlinear models reported in the literature, we derive new theoretical results on the R-E tradeoff, which are in sharp contrast to those in the existing literature obtained with linear energy harvesting.

In this paper, two RIS-based SSK schemes are proposed to efficiently improve the error and throughput performance of conventional SSK systems, respectively. The first one, termed RIS-SSK with passive beamforming (RIS-SSK-PB), employs an RIS for beamforming and targets the maximization of the minimum squared Euclidean distance between any two decision points. The second one, termed RIS-SSK with Alamouti space-time block coding (RIS-SSK-ASTBC), employs an RIS for ASTBC and enables the RIS to transmit its own Alamouti-coded information while reflecting the incident SSK signals to the destination. A low-complexity beamformer and an efficient maximum-likelihood (ML) detector are designed for RIS-SSK-PB and RIS-SSK-ASTBC, respectively. Approximate expressions for the average bit error probabilities of the source and/or the RIS are derived in closed-form assuming ML detection. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to verify the performance analysis. Results show that RIS-SSK-PB significantly outperforms the existing RIS-free and RIS-based SSK schemes, and RIS-SSK-ASTBC enables highly reliable transmission with throughput improvement.},

   abstract = {In this two-part paper, we study three capacity regions for fading broadcast channels and obtain their corresponding optimal resource allocation strategies: the ergodic (Shannon) capacity region, the zero-outage capacity region, and the capacity region with outage. In Part I, we obtained the ergodic capacity region of the fading broadcast channel under different spectrum-sharing techniques. In this paper, we derive the outage capacity regions of fading broadcast channels, assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information. These capacity regions and the associate optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for code division (CD) with and without successive decoding, for time division (TD), and for frequency division (FD). We show that in an M-user broadcast system, the outage capacity region is implicitly obtained by deriving the outage probability region for a given rate vector. Given the required rate of each user, we find a strategy which bounds the outage probability region for different spectrum-sharing techniques. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multiuser generalization of the threshold-decision rule for a single-user fading channel. Also discussed is a simpler minimum common outage probability problem under the assumption that the broadcast channel is either not used at all when fading is severe or used simultaneously for all users. Numerical results for the different outage capacity regions are obtained for the Nakagami-m fading model.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-based modulation scheme, named RIS-aided receive quadrature reflecting modulation (RIS-RQRM), by resorting to the concept of spatial modulation. In RIS-RQRM, the whole RIS is virtually partitioned into two halves to create signals with only in-phase (I-) and quadrature (Q-) components, respectively, and each half forms a beam to a receive antenna whose index carries the bit information. Furthermore, we design a low-complexity and non-coherent detector for RIS-RQRM, which measures the maximum power and polarities of the I- and Q- components of received signals. Approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions are derived for RIS-RQRM over Rician fading channels. Simulation results show that RIS-RQRM outperforms the existing counterparts without I/Q index modulation in terms of BER in the low signal-to-noise ratio region.},

For the P-BF design, we propose to maximize the achievable user sum rate of the RIS-aided Mu-MIMO channel and formulate the problem as a two-step stochastic program. A sample average approximation (SAA) based iterative algorithm is developed for the efficient P-BF design of the considered scheme. To strike a balance between complexity and performance, we further propose a simplified P-BF algorithm by approximating the stochastic program as a deterministic alternating optimization problem. For the receiver design, the signal detection at the receiver is a bilinear estimation problem since the RIS information is multiplicatively modulated onto the reflected signals of the reflecting elements. To solve this bilinear estimation problem, we develop a turbo message passing (TMP) algorithm in which the factor graph associated with the problem is divided into two modules: one for the estimation of the user signals and the other for the estimation of the on-off state of each RIS element. The two modules are executed iteratively to yield a near-optimal low-complexity solution. Furthermore, we extend the design of the Mu-MIMO PBIT scheme from single-RIS to multi-RIS, by leveraging the similarity between the single-RIS and multi-RIS system models. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our P-BF and receiver designs.},

In this article, we aim for the implementation of single-RF MIMO by shifting the focus from SM to metasurface-based modulation. Specifically, the principles of SM and metasurfaces are first presented. After reviewing the evolution of SM, we elaborate on the idea of metasurface-aided single-RF MIMO and discuss some implementations for it in line with notable variants of SM. A comparison between antenna-based and metasurface-based modulation is made to highlight the advantages of using metasurfaces.

We first review results for the Shannon capacity of fading channels with channel side information, where capacity is achieved using adaptive transmission techniques. We then derive the spectral efficiency of our proposed modulation. We show that there is a constant power gap between the spectral efficiency of our proposed technique and the channel capacity, and this gap is a simple function of the required bit5or rate (BER). In addition, using just five or six different signal constellations, we achieve within 1-2 dB of the maximum efficiency using unrestricted constellation sets. We compute the rate at which the transmitter needs to update its power and rate as a function of the channel Doppler frequency for these constellation sets. We also obtain the exact efficiency loss for smaller constellation sets, which may be required if the transmitter adaptation rate is constrained by hardware limitations. Our modulation scheme exhibits a 5-10-dB power gain relative to variable-power fixed-rate transmission, and up to 20 dB of gain relative to nonadaptive transmission. We also determine the effect of channel estimation error and delay on the BER performance of our adaptive scheme. We conclude with a discussion of coding techniques and the relationship between our proposed modulation and Shannon capacity. © 1997 IEEE.},

In the reflecting optimization with a fixed precoder, two reflecting design methods are developed, referred as eMSER-Reflecting and vMSER-Reflecting.

The superiority of the proposed designs is investigated by simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reflecting and precoding designs can offer a lower SER than existing designs with the assumption of complex Gaussian input.

The outage performance of phase-quantized system is also investigated for the case of Rayleigh fading when the channel state information (CSI) is only known at the receiver.

A closed-form expression does not exist for the lognormal characteristic function; as a result no closed-form expression can be derived for the sum distribution. Many approximations exist that are based on approximating a sum of lognormal random variables as another lognormal random variable. A new method for calculating an approximation to a lognormal sum distribution, based on curve fitting on lognormal probability paper is introduced in this paper. Accurate, simple closed-form approximations to distributions and densities of lognormal sum random variables are presented.},

   abstract = {As the research on beyond 5G heats up, we survey and explore power and bandwidth efficient modulation schemes in details. In the existing publications and in various communication standards, initially square quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM) constellations (even power of 2) were considered. However, only the square constellations are not efficient for varying channel conditions and rate requirements, and hence, odd power of 2 constellations were introduced. For odd power of 2 constellations, rectangular QAM (RQAM) is commonly used. However, RQAM is not a good choice due to its lower power efficiency, and a modified cross QAM (XQAM) constellation is preferred as it provides improved power efficiency over RQAM due to its energy efficient two dimensional (2D) structure. The increasing demand for high data-rates has further encouraged the research towards more compact 2D constellations which lead to hexagonal lattice structure based constellations, referred to as hexagonal QAM (HQAM). In this work, various QAM constellations are discussed and detailed study of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations is presented. Generation, peak and average energies, peak-to-average-power ratio, symbol-error-rate, decision boundaries, bit mapping, Gray code penalty, and bit-error-rate of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations with different constellation orders are presented. Finally, a comparative study of various QAM constellations is presented which justifies the supremacy of HQAM over other QAM constellations. With this, it can be claimed that the use of the HQAM in various wireless communication systems and standards can further improve the performance targeted for beyond 5G wireless communication systems.},

   abstract = {Backscatter provides dual-benefits of energy harvesting and low-power communication, making it attractive to a broad class of wireless sensors. But the design of a protocol that enables extremely power-efficient radios for harvesting-based sensors as well as high-rate data transfer for data-rich sensors presents a conundrum. In this paper, we present a new \{\em fully asymmetric\} backscatter communication protocol where nodes blindly transmit data as and when they sense. This model enables fully flexible node designs, from extraordinarily power-efficient backscatter radios that consume barely a few micro-watts to high-throughput radios that can stream at hundreds of Kbps while consuming a paltry tens of micro-watts. The challenge, however, lies in decoding concurrent streams at the reader, which we achieve using a novel combination of time-domain separation of interleaved signal edges, and phase-domain separation of colliding transmissions. We provide an implementation of our protocol, LF-Backscatter, and show that it can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in throughput, latency and power over state-of-art alternatives.},

   abstract = {Reducing the power consumption of a passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tag is the key in many applications. As the modulator is usually the most power-hungry block in an RFID tag, this paper proposes a power-saving modulator. The proposed modulator uses phase shift keying (PSK) backscatter modulation which allows tag to communicate data from its memory to a reader by PSK modulation. The proposed modulator uses a MOSCAP as a variable impedance and is designed in a new one-inverter structure in compare to the conventional varactor-based modulators designed in two-inverter structure, as this modulator needs just a low voltage swing to drive its MOSCAP. Using MOSCAP as the variable capacitance leads to a low voltage design. Also, the fundamental equations required for determination of the capacitive impedance seen by the antenna is presented. This impedance is the master key in modulator design. The modulator has been designed, simulated and optimized in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. All possible simulation results are presented to approve its compatible operation with C1 G2 EPC global standard. The power consumption of less than 46 nW is achieved in all process corner cases at 0.8 V power supply. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Instead of assuming Gaussian input distribution, the proposed study matches the practical ambient backscatter scenarios, where the input of the tag can only be binary. We derive the closed-form capacity expression as well as the capacity-achieving input distribution for the BIBO channel. To show the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the capacity, a closed-form tight ceiling is also derived when SNR turns relatively large. For BISO and BIEO channel, we obtain the closed-form mutual information, while the semi-closed-form capacity value can be obtained via one dimensional searching. Simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical studies. Interestingly, the simulations show that: (i) the detection threshold maximizing the capacity of BIBO channel is the same as the one from the maximum likelihood signal detection; (ii) the maximal of the mutual information of all channels is achieved almost by a uniform input distribution; and (iii) the mutual information of the BIEO channel is larger than that of the BIBO channel, but is smaller than that of the BISO channel.},

Due to its simple hardware and support for wireless power transfer, it is well suited for the implementation of IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a backscatter relay network where backscatter devices are wirelessly powered by a hybrid access point (HAP). The signals beamformed by the HAP also act as carrier emitters for backscatter devices to modulate and transmit data. Some backscatter devices are unable to directly communicate with the HAP. Nearby backscatter devices present in the network assist these devices with a goal of providing access to the HAP and improving their throughput via cooperative transmission. A maximization problem is formulated to maximize the overall throughput of a distant device with a relay strategy for the considered backscatter relay network. We also propose a procedure to acquire accurate channel information of all the channels to ensure efficient beamforming at the HAP. Numerical results show that accurate channel information can significantly improve the overall throughput of the proposed backscatter relay network. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme shows the effect of different system parameters on the overall system throughput.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a backscatter cooperation (BC) scheme is proposed for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission. The key idea is to backscatter the surplus power of the received downlink signals at one user to enhance the reception of the user who cannot recover its information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed BC-NOMA scheme, three benchmark schemes are introduced, which include the non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA scheme, the conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA scheme, and the incremental relaying (IR)-NOMA scheme. For all these schemes, the outage performance, the expected rate, and the diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) performance are analyzed. Additionally, the optimal power allocation to maximize the expected rate of the BC-NOMA scheme in the high signal-to-noise ratio region is derived. The theoretical results show that the proposed BC-NOMA can enhance both transmission reliability (outage performance) and transmission effectiveness (expected rate) compared with NC-NOMA. Furthermore, representative numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results. It is shown that unlike the two relaying-based cooperative schemes (CR/IR-NOMA), which improve the outage performance at the cost of transmission rate, the proposed BC-NOMA scheme can enhance the transmission reliability without impairing the spectrum efficiency, which makes backscattering an appealing solution to cooperative NOMA downlinks.},

In this paper, we propose a distributed IRS-empowered communication network architecture, where multiple sourcedestination pairs communicate through multiple distributed IRSs. We further contribute to maximize the achievable sum-rates in this network via jointly optimizing the transmit power vector at the sources and the phase shift matrix with passive beamforming at all distributed IRSs. Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be non-convex and highly intractable, for which an alternating approach is developed via solving the resulting fractional programming problems alternatively. In particular, the closed-form expressions are proposed for coordinated passive beamforming at IRSs. The numerical results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and desirable performances of the distributed IRSempowered communication network.},

We propose using the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), i.e., multiplexing the BNs in different regions or with different backscattered power levels, to enhance the spectrum efficiency of the BackCom system. To better exploit power-domain NOMA, we propose setting the reflection coefficients for multiplexed BNs to be different. Based on this considered model, we develop the reflection coefficient selection criteria. To illustrate the enhanced system with the proposed criteria, we analyze the performance of the BackCom system in terms of the average number of bits that can be successfully decoded by the reader for the two-node pairing case and the average number of successful BNs for the general multiplexing case. Our results show that NOMA achieves the much better performance gain in the BackCom system as compared to its performance gain in the conventional system, which highlights the importance of applying NOMA to the BackCom system.},

In order to obtain a benchmark for overall detection, we first derive a maximum likelihood detector assuming a complex Gaussian ambient source, and the closed-form bit error rate (BER) is computed. To release the dependence on prior knowledge of the ambient source, we next derive a type of robust design, called an energy detector, with the ambient signal being either complex Gaussian or phase shift keying (PSK). The closed-form detection thresholds, analytical BERs, and outage probability are provided correspondingly. Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor, while the PSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation design as opposed to popular Gaussian-embedded literatures.

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem for the symbiotic radio system, in which the passive backscatter transmission is parasitic in the primary transmission, and the cooperative receiver simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from the active primary transmitter (PT) and the backscatter device (BD). In particular, channel fading is considered, and the ergodic weighted sum rate of the primary and backscatter transmissions is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the PT and the reflection coefficient at the BD under either long-term or short-term transmit-power constraint over the fading states. Two practical transmission setups are considered, where the relationship between the primary and backscatter transmissions is either commensal or parasitic. For the commensal setup, we fix the reflection coefficient as the maximum value and derive the optimal power allocation scheme based on the standard convex optimization procedure. For the parasitic setup, the weighted sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex, and we resort to the concave-convex procedure to derive a suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that in the commensal setup, the BD may realize transmission while causing no harmful interference to the primary system; in the parasitic setup, a higher backscatter data rate can be achieved through slightly sacrificing the primary transmission rate.},

It is challenging to accommodate these devices with high throughput and long range because of the low efficiency inherent in ambient backscatter. To tackle the challenging issue, we propose an optimum modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for ambient backscatter communication networks (ABCN). We model and analyze the ABCN embedded by semi-passive tags with M-ary modulation and full-duplex WiFi access points as reader. The coverage and network capacity are derived, by which the effect of various system parameters including reflection coefficient, code rate, and cluster size is investigated.

   abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radiowaves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconflgurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconflgurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

The convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed.

To avoid the need of the instantaneous information, including the specific codes and the instantaneous channel state information of the backscatter links, and to optimize the transmit power and the BD reflection coefficients, we derive the asymptotic BD signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by employing the large-dimension random matrix theory. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum asymptotic SINR among BDs with guaranteeing the primary target rate. By investigating the property of the problem, the original problem is transformed and solved by the proposed iterative-based algorithm.

In Part I, we obtained the ergodic capacity region of the fading broadcast channel under different spectrum-sharing techniques. In this paper, we derive the outage capacity regions of fading broadcast channels, assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information. These capacity regions and the associate optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for code division (CD) with and without successive decoding, for time division (TD), and for frequency division (FD). We show that in an M-user broadcast system, the outage capacity region is implicitly obtained by deriving the outage probability region for a given rate vector. Given the required rate of each user, we find a strategy which bounds the outage probability region for different spectrum-sharing techniques. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multiuser generalization of the threshold-decision rule for a single-user fading channel. Also discussed is a simpler minimum common outage probability problem under the assumption that the broadcast channel is either not used at all when fading is severe or used simultaneously for all users. Numerical results for the different outage capacity regions are obtained for the Nakagami-m fading model.},

Therefore, intelligent scheduling protocols and technologies such as wireless power transfer, are important for the efficient implementation of these massive low-powered networks. This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network, where multiple batteryless devices harvest radio-frequency from a dedicated transmitter in order to communicate with a common information receiver (IR). We investigate several novel selection schemes, corresponding to different channel state information requirements and implementation complexities. In particular, each scheme schedules the $k$-th best device based on: a) the end-to-end (e2e) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), b) the energy harvested at the devices, c) the uplink transmission to the IR, and d) the conventional/legacy max-min selection policy. We consider a non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of each selection scheme by using tools from high order statistics. %Our results show that, the performance of all the proposed schemes converges to an error floor due to the saturation effects of the considered EH model. Moreover, an asymptotic scenario in terms of the number of devices is considered and, by applying extreme value theory, the system's performance is evaluated.

In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region.

In return, the primary communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive BD access.},

Ambient backscattering devices reflect RF signals emitted by existing or legacy communications systems, such as digital TV broadcasting, cellular, or Wi-Fi ones, which are designed for transporting information and are not intended for RF energy transfer. This paper deals with mathematical modeling and performance analysis of wireless broadband networks operating over fading channels with ambient backscatter devices. After introducing a detailed signal model of the relevant communication links, we study the influence of physical parameters on the capacity of both legacy and backscatter channels, by considering different receiver architectures. We analytically show that, under reasonable operative conditions, a legacy system - employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme - can turn the RF interference arising from the backscatter process into a form of multipath diversity that can be exploited to increase its performance. Moreover, our analysis proves that a backscatter system - transmitting one symbol per OFDM symbol of the legacy system - can achieve satisfactory data rates over relatively short distances, especially when the intended recipient of the backscatter signal is co-located with the legacy transmitter, i.e., they are on the same device.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study on the MIMO techniques for the $M \times L$ monostatic channel. Particularly we study on the joint design of the query and the coding matrices. We show that the maximum achievable diversity order of the monostatic channel is the diversity order achieved by the block-lever unitary query and orthogonal space-time block code (BUTQ-OSTBC) design pair, which is $\frac \{ML\}\{2\}$ , exactly the half of the diversity order of the conventional MIMO channel. Then we show that uniform query, the simplest query approach, cannot achieve the maximum achievable diversity order in the monostatic channel. We generalize BUTQ-OSTBC to the general augmenting approach, and show that unitary matrix is optimal in terms of SER performance among all possible query matrices, when OSTBC is employed. The above results further indicate that in the backscatter channel, additional diversity can be obtained by varying the query signals over time slots within the channel coherent time, which is quite different from the results from the conventional MIMO channels.

   abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.},

In such scenarios, a secondary user (SU) can operate in either transmission mode or backscatter mode. Specifically, an SU can directly transmit data if sufficient energy has been harvested (i.e., transmission mode). Or an SU can backscatter ambient signals to transmit data (i.e., backscatter mode). In this paper, for investigating the performance of such systems, we apply stochastic geometry to analyze coverage probability and achievable rates for both primary and secondary users considering both communication modes. Analytical tractable expressions are obtained. Extensive simulations are performed and the numerical results show the validity of our analysis. Furthermore, the results indicate that the performance of secondary systems can be improved with the integration of both communication modes with only limited impact on the performance of primary systems.},

The proposed scheme combines user scheduling based on time division multiple access (TDMA) and (mechanical) angular displacement of the IRS. Each energy harvesting user (EHU) has dedicated time slots with optimized durations for energy harvesting and information transmission whereas, the phase matrix of the IRS is adjusted to focus its beam to a particular EHU. The proposed scheme exploits the fundamental dependence of the IRS channel path-loss on the angle between the IRS and the node&#x2019;s line-of-sight, which is often overlooked in the literature. Additionally, the network design can be optimized for large number of IRS unit cells, which is not the case with the computationally intensive state-of-the-art schemes. In fact, the EHUs can achieve significant rates at practical distances of several tens of meters to the base station (BS) only if the number of IRS unit cells is at least a few thousand.},

   abstract = {Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) is an emerging communication technology enabling green Internet-of-Things deployments. The widespread acceptance of this paradigm is limited by the low Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of the signal impinging on the receiver antenna due to the strong direct path interference and unknown ambient signal. The adverse impact of these two factors can be mitigated by using non-coherent multi-antenna receivers, which are known to require a higher SINR to reach the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of coherent receivers. However, considering the unknown ambient signal, unknown location of AmBC tags, and varying channel conditions, coherent receivers for AmBC systems are rarely studied in literature. In this paper, a coherent multi-antenna receiver, which requires no prior information of the ambient signal for decoding the Binary-Phase-shift-Keying (BPSK) modulated signal, is presented. The performance of the proposed receiver is compared with an ideal coherent receiver that has perfect phase information, and also with the performance of a non-coherent receiver, which assumes distributions for ambient signal and phase offset caused by the excess length of the backscatter path. Comparative simulation results show the designed receiver can achieve the same BER performance of the ideal coherent receiver with 1-dB more SINR, which corresponds to 5-dB or more gain with respect to non-coherent reception of On-Off-Keying modulated signals. Variation in the detection performance with the tag location shows that the coverage area is in the close vicinity of the transmitter and a larger region around the receiver, which is consistent with the theoretical results.},

Various revolutionary technologies and innovative services are offered in 5G networks, which, along with many principal advantages, are anticipated to bring a boom in the number of connected wireless devices and the types of use-cases that may cause the scarcity of network resources. These challenges partly emerged with the advent of massive machine-type communications (mMTC) services, require extensive research innovations to sustain the evolution towards enhanced-mMTC (e-mMTC) with the scalable network cost in 6th generation (6G) wireless networks. Towards delivering the anticipated massive connectivity requirements with optimal energy and spectral efficiency besides low hardware cost, this paper presents an enabling framework for 6G networks, which utilizes two emerging technologies, namely, non-coherent communications and backscatter communications (BsC). Recognizing the coherence between these technologies for their joint potential of delivering e-mMTC services in the B5G era, a comprehensive review of their state-of-the-art is conducted. The joint scope of non-coherent and BsC with other emerging 6G technologies is also identified, where the reviewed technologies include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted communications, visible light communications (VLC), quantum-assisted communications, reconfigurable large intelligent surfaces (RLIS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and machine learning (ML)-aided intelligent networks. Subsequently, the scope of these enabling technologies for different device types (e.g., UAVs, body implants, etc), service types (e.g., e-mMTC), and optimization parameters (e.g., spectrum, energy, cost) is analyzed. Finally, in the context of the proposed non-coherent and BsCs based framework for e-mMTCs, some promising future research directions and open research challenges are highlighted.},

To deal with the non-convex problem, we firstly transform it into an equivalently subtractive form via Dinkelbach's method. Then, we apply a variable substitution approach to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, where the closed-form solutions of the reflection coefficient, the transmit power, and the EH time are deduced by using Lagrange dual method.

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) over orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals has recently been proposed as an appealing technique for low power Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The special spectrum structure of OFDM signals provides a range of flexibility in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance, data rate, and power consumption. In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter communication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme, and its two modifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance compared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per subcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the first modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed to improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels. It results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks, and data rate. Thus, in the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to mitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also stabilizes, and controls the power of the signal to result in interference reduction for a legacy receiver. Analytical, and numerical evaluations provide a proof to see the performance of the proposed method in terms of BER, data rate, and interference.},

   abstract = {Backscatter communication is a promising solution for enabling information transmission between ultra-low-power devices, but its potential is not fully understood. One major problem is dealing with the interference between the backscatter devices, which is usually not taken into account, or simply treated as noise in the cases where there are a limited number of backscatter devices in the network. In order to better understand this problem in the context of massive IoT (Internet of Things), we consider a network with a base station having one antenna, serving one primary user, and multiple IoT devices, called secondary users. We formulate an optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the needed transmit power for the base station, while the ratio of backscattered signal, called backscatter coefficient, is optimized for each of the IoT devices. Such an optimization problem is non-convex and thus finding an optimal solution in real-time is challenging. In this paper, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal solution, and show that it is unique. Furthermore, we develop an efficient solution algorithm, only requiring solving a linear system of equations with as many unknowns as the number of secondary users. The simulation results show a lower energy outage probability by up to 40-80 percentage points in dense networks with up to 150 secondary users. To our knowledge, this is the first work that studies backscatter communication in the context of massive IoT, also taking into account the interference between devices.},

Such problem is nonconvex with infinite number of constraints. Using certain transformation techniques, we convert this problem into a relaxed semidefinite programming problem (SDP) which can be solved efficiently. We further show that the solution of the relaxed SDP problem is always rank-one. This indicates that the relaxation is tight and we can get the optimal solution for the original problem.

   abstract = {This paper presents a scalable uplink multiple access (SUMA) protocol for bistatic Wi-Fi backscatter systems, composed of a Wi-Fi reader, Wi-Fi helper, and multiple Wi-Fi backscatter tags. SUMA uses a Wi-Fi reader-initiated dynamic framed slotted ALOHA (DFSA)-based multiple access protocol to minimize collisions caused by simultaneous Wi-Fi backscatter uplink traffic from multiple Wi-Fi backscatter tags. In SUMA, the Wi-Fi helper first estimates the number of tags at the start of network operation and derives an appropriate slot-count parameter (i.e., $Q$ ), based on which the frame size is specified. Then, the Wi-Fi helper adaptively adjusts the value of $Q$ to maximize network performance while continuously monitoring the number of remaining Wi-Fi backscatter tags to detect information. An experimental simulation was performed to verify the superiority of SUMA. The results demonstrated that SUMA obtained higher performance in terms of the number of collided and empty slots, delay, and throughput compared with the legacy DFSA approach adopted in the EPCglobal Class 1 Gen 2 standard.},

   abstract = {Backscattering communications have been recently proposed as an effective enabling technology for massive Internet of Things (IoT) development. A novel application of backscattering, called ambient backscattering (AmBC), has been gaining much attention, wherein backscattering communications exploit existing RF signals without the need for a dedicated transmitter. In such a system, data demodulation process is strongly complicated by the random nature of the illuminating signal, as well as by the presence of the direct-link interference (DLI) from the legacy system. To overcome these shortcomings, one can resort to noncoherent detection strategies, aimed at reducing or even nullifying the amount of a priori information needed to reliably perform signal demodulation. This paper deals with the problem of noncoherent maximumlikelihood (ML) signal detection for backscatter communications over ambient OFDM. The performance of the proposed detector is corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations.},

   abstract = {Low-power ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) relying on radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is an energy-efficient solution for batteryless Internet of Things (IoT). However, ambient backscatter signals are severely faded by dyadic backscatter channel (DBC), limiting connectivity in conventional orthogonal time-division-based AmBC (TD-AmBC). In order to support massive connectivity in AmBC, we propose sparse-coded AmBC (SC-AmBC) based on non-orthogonal signaling. Sparse code utilizes inherent sparsity of AmBC where power supplies of RF tags rely on ambient RF energy harvesting. Consequently, sparse-coded backscatter modulation algorithm (SC-BMA) can enable non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as well as M-ary modulation for concurrent backscatter transmissions, providing additional diversity gain. These sparse codewords from multiple tags can be efficiently detected at access point (AP) using iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). To overcome DBC along with intersymbol interference (ISI), we propose dyadic channel estimation algorithm (D-CEA) and dyadic MPA (D-MPA) exploiting weighted-sum of the ISI for information exchange in the factor graph. Simulation results validate the potential of the SC-AmBC in terms of connectivity, detection performance and sum throughput.},

This paper proposed the large-scale tags/sensors multi-hop communication protocols with energy harvesting under Wi-Fi architecture, where the 'CTS-to-self' frame can be used to set the traditional AP/STA to the sensing status without sending, and then, the new defined frame 'Multi-RTS' may send the trigger signal to massive tags or sensors with its frame field as 'M-RTS' strategy, compressed bitmap, tags/sensors number, and other messages. The tags/sensors shall respond to the sounding signal and give the backscatter signal to AP using energy harvesting. It can be mentioned that the Wi-Fi standard in this paper is based on the IEEE 802.11ah. Finally, AP can collect and modulate the backscatter signal after massive tags/sensors response to the reader. It was worth noting that the multi-hop relay adopts the power splitting way to implement the communication process, where the object function was energy efficiency maximization with the parameters optimization of transmitting power and relay scaling factor. In order to solve the non-convex problem, this paper derived the approximate expression in the high SNR case and achieved the optimal solution via the Lambert W function. The simulation and analysis verified the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the correctness of the derivations.},

The key idea is to enable one user to split and then backscatter part of its received signals to improve the reception at another user. To evaluate its performance, three benchmark schemes are introduced. They are non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA, conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA, and incremental relaying (IR)-NOMA. For all these schemes, the analytical expressions of the minimum total power to avoid information outage are derived, based on which their respective outage performance, expected rates, and diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) are investigated. Analytical results show that the proposed BC-NOMA strictly outperforms NC-NOMA in terms of all the three metrics. Furthermore, theoretical analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that compared with CR/IR-NOMA, only the proposed BC-NOMA scheme can enhance the transmission reliability without impairing the transmission rate.},

In the existing related studies, the adopted centralized approach might be not suitable for a large-scale IoT network with sporadic backscatter communication, while the adopted distributed approach ignored the demand of the access point (AP). In this paper, we consider a large-scale IoT network consisting of the legacy Wi-Fi communication and the backscatter communication, and aim to propose an efficient distributed backscatter medium access control protocol that takes into account of the demand of the AP. In our protocol, when the AP has a demand to collect the information of backscatter devices, it enables backscatter devices to contend for the channel with Wi-Fi devices in a separate manner, where the backscatter devices are only allowed to participate in the contention in a limited time period. We then characterize this constrained contention process and develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of the proposed protocol. With this model, we can exactly express the per-node throughput of Wi-Fi and backscatter devices. Finally, extensive simulations verify that our model is much accurate, and our protocol can outperform the related protocol in terms of both per-node throughput and system throughput.},

We study the transmit power minimization problem at the carrier emitter, where its transmit beamforming vector is jointly optimized with the IRS phase shifts, whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. A unique feature in this system setup is the multiple IRS reflections experienced by signals traveling from the carrier emitter to the reader, which renders the optimization problem highly nonconvex. Therefore, we propose algorithms based on the minorization-maximization and alternating optimization techniques to obtain approximate solutions for the joint design. We also propose low-complexity algorithms based on successive optimization of individual phase shifts. Our results reveal considerable transmit power savings in both single-tag and multi-tag systems, even with moderate IRS sizes, which may be translated to significant range improvements using the original transmit power or reduce the reliance of tags on carrier emitters located at close range.},

   abstract = {The joint probability density function (pdf) of the received signal of an ambient backscatter communication system is derived, assuming that on-off keying (OOK) is performed at the tag to form non-return to zero (NRZ) line codes, and that the ambient radio frequency (RF) signal is white Gaussian. The pdf of the received signal is then utilized to design two different types of non-coherent detectors. The first detector directly uses the received signal to perform a hypothesis test. The second detector first estimates the channel based on the observed signal and then performs the hypothesis test. Test statistics and the optimal decision threshold of the detectors are derived. The energy detector is shown to be an approximation of the second detector. For cases where the reader is able to avoid or cancel the direct interference from the RF source (e.g., through successive interference cancellation), a third detector is given as a special case of the first detector. Numerical results show that the first detector outperforms the second detector, although the second detector is computationally simpler.},

Modeling the time-selective fading channel as a first-order autoregressive (AR) process, we propose a new receiver architecture based on the direct averaging of the received signal samples for detection, which departs significantly from the energy averaging-based receivers considered in the literature. For the proposed setup, we characterize the exact asymptotic bit error rate (BER) for both single-antenna (SA) and multi-antenna (MA) receivers, and demonstrate the robustness of the new architecture to timing errors. Our results demonstrate that while the direct-link (DL) interference from the ambient power source leads to a BER floor in the SA receiver, the MA receiver can remove this interference by estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of the DL. The analysis further quantifies the effect of improved angular resolution on the BER as a function of the number of receive antennas. A key intermediate result of our analysis is the derivation of a new concentration result for a general sum sequence that is central to the derivation of the conditional distributions of the received signal.},

   abstract = {Spectrum sensing is an essential technology to detect the presence of primary users' (PUs) signals in cognitive radio (CR) networks. To achieve desirable performances under shadowing and fading environments, cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed as a promising scheme, which takes advantage of spatial and multiuser diversity gain. In this paper, we investigate cooperative sensing (CS) in a heterogeneous CR network scenario, where each secondary user (SU) may be equipped with different numbers of receive antennas and may have different signal processing capabilities, e.g., sampling rates. By considering the discrepancy in sensing reliability of different SUs, we propose an optimal normalized energy detection-based CS (NED-CS) scheme by virtue of the principle of log-likelihood ratio test (LRT). This LRT-based NED-CS scheme also takes into account the reporting errors at a fusion center (FC), which may receive erroneous results from some SUs due to channel fading and quantization errors. Our derivation shows that the detection statistic of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme is the linear combination of modified local detection statistics, and the optimal combining coefficient can be shown to be a function of the numbers of antennas, the received signal samples, the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and the variances of reporting errors at each SU. Meanwhile, to drop the prerequisite on a priori information on the received SNRs of all SUs and the variances of reporting errors and to simplify the decision making and threshold setting, a simplified LRT (SLRT)-based NED-CS scheme is proposed as well. Furthermore, we analyze and compare the performance of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme with existing NED-CS schemes, including the equal gain combination (EGC) method and the maximum normalized energy (MNE) detector, with reporting errors under both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels in a heterogeneous CR network. We derive the probability density function (PDF) of received SNR at each SU and obtain the series expansions and closed-form approximate expressions of detection and false alarm probabilities of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme. Our analytical results match simulation results well, and both of them show that the proposed LRT- and SLRT-based NED-CS schemes perform significantly better than the existing EGC and MNE methods.},

Based on these axioms, we propose the concept of Time Varying Binary Symmetric Channel (TV-BSC). We show that the TV-BSC is unique as the simplest model that exhibits a non-trivial influence on capacity due to the channel uncertainty. That an influence of the channel uncertainty is captured serves to significantly differentiate the model from other two-state Markov models, especially from the the Gilbert-Elliott model. We use several methods to calculate the information capacity of the TV-BSC. Furthermore, we find accurate approximations for the TV-BSC information capacity, providing better inside into the capacity analysis of more general time varying communication channels. © 2004 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is the basis of a family of advanced air interfaces in current and future generation networks. The benefits promised by CDMA have not been fully realized partly due to the prohibitive complexity of optimal detection and decoding of many users communicating simultaneously using the same frequency band. From both theoretical and practical perspectives, this paper advocates a new paradigm of CDMA with sparse spreading sequences, which enables near-optimal multiuser detection using belief propagation (BP) with low-complexity. The scheme is in part inspired by capacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the success of iterative decoding techniques. Specifically, it is shown that BP-based detection is optimal in the large-system limit under many practical circumstances, which is a unique advantage of sparsely spread CDMA systems. Moreover, it is shown that, from the viewpoint of an individual user, the CDMA channel is asymptotically equivalent to a scalar Gaussian channel with some degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The degradation factor, known as the multiuser efficiency, can be determined from a fixed-point equation. The results in this paper apply to a broad class of sparse, semi-regular CDMA systems with arbitrary input and power distribution. Numerical results support the theoretical findings for systems of moderate size, which further demonstrate the appeal of sparse spreading in practical applications. © 2008 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose novel encoding methods at the information tag and devise the corresponding symbol detection methods at the reader. In particular, Manchester coding and differential Manchester coding are adopted at the information tag, and the corresponding semi-coherent Manchester (SeCoMC) and non-coherent Manchester (NoCoMC) detectors are developed. In addition, analytical bit-error-rate (BER) expressions are characterized for both detectors assuming either complex Gaussian or unknown deterministic ambient signal. Simulation results show that the BER performance of unknown deterministic ambient signal is better, and the SeCoMC detector outperforms the NoCoMC detector. Finally, compared with the prior detectors for ambient backscatter communications, the proposed detectors have the advantages of achieving superior BER performance with lower communication delay.},

   abstract = {Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique for 5G wireless networks. In uplink NOMA, more than one user can use the same subcarrier, which increases the system throughput and fairness. Due to the non-orthogonality among the users, joint processing is required at the receiver to retrieve the users' signals. In this paper, we propose solutions to optimize the receiver and the radio resource allocation of uplink NOMA. First, we propose an iterative multiuser detection and decoding (MUDD) to improve the performance of the multiuser detector by utilizing the information derived by the channel decoder. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is proposed for NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' weighted sumrate. The link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed iterative MUDD approach brings about 4.5 dB and 9.8 dB performance improvements at block error rate equal to 10 -2 comparing to conventional multiuser detection, for QPSK and 16QAM modulations, respectively. Furthermore, the systemlevel results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithm achieves the system spectral efficiency upper-bound, making NOMA significantly outperforms OFDMA in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness.},

   abstract = {Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has appeared as a powerful transmission and multiple access strategy for multi-user multi-antenna communications. Uniquely, this paper studies the optimization of the sum-rate of RSMA with imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) and the receivers (CSIR). The robustness of the RSMA approach against imperfect CSIT has been investigated in the previous studies while there has been no consideration for the effects of imperfect CSIR. This motivates us to develop a robust design relying on RSMA in the presence of both imperfect CSIT and CSIR. Since the optimization problem for the design of RSMA precoder and power allocations to maximize the sum-rate is non-convex, it is hard to solve directly. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a novel alternating optimization algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) techniques. By comparing simulation results with conventional methods, it turns out that RSMA is quite robust to imperfect CSIR and CSIT, thereby improving the sum-rate performance.},

Particularly, the performance of NOMA is studied by assuming two types of partial channel state information (CSI). For the first one, which is based on imperfect CSI, we present a simple closed-form approximation for the outage probability and the average sum rate, as well as their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions. For the second type of CSI, which is based on second order statistics (SOS), we derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability and an approximate expression for the average sum rate for the special case two users. For the addressed scenario with the two types of partial CSI, the results demonstrate that NOMA can achieve superior performance compared to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Moreover, SOS-based NOMA always achieves better performance than that with imperfect CSI, while it can achieve similar performance to the NOMA with perfect CSI at the low SNR region. The provided numerical results confirm that the derived expressions for the outage probability and the average sum rate match well with the Monte Carlo simulations.},

Unfortunately, ML detection (MLD) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, for which there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity (in the number of users). In this paper, a polynomial-time approximation method called semi-definite (SD) relaxation is applied to the MLD problem with antipodal data transmission. SD relaxation is an accurate approximation method for certain NP-hard problems. The SD relaxation ML (SDR-ML) detector is efficient in that its complexity is of the order of K 3.5, where K is the number of users. We illustrate the potential of the SDR-ML detector by showing that some existing detectors, such as the decorrelator and the linear-minimum-mean-square-error detector, can be interpreted as degenerate forms of the SDR-ML detector. Simulation results indicate that the BER performance of the SDR-ML detector is better than that of these existing detectors and is close to that of the true ML detector, even when the cross-correlations between users are strong or the near-far effect is significant.},

   abstract = {This paper considers the forward error correction (FEC) code design for approaching the capacity of a dynamic multiple access channel (MAC) where both the number of users and their respective signal powers keep constantly changing, resembling the scenario of an actual wireless cellular system. To obtain a low-complexity non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, we propose a serial concatenation of a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and a repetition code (REP), this way achieving near Gaussian MAC (GMAC) capacity performance while coping with the dynamics of the MAC system. The joint optimization of the LDPC and REP codes is addressed by matching the analytical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions of the sub-optimal multi-user detector (MUD) and the channel code for a specific and static MAC system, achieving near-GMAC capacity. We show that the near-capacity performance can be flexibly maintained with the same LDPC code regardless of the variations in the number of users and power levels. This flexibility (or elasticity) is provided by the REP code, acting as “user-load and power equalizer”, dramatically simplifying the practical implementation of NOMA schemes, as only a single LDPC code is needed to cope with the dynamics of the MAC system.},

In this paper, we consider a backscatter communication network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each backscatter radio uses the harvested energy to power its data transmissions, in which some other radios can help as the wireless relays with an aim to improve throughput performance by cooperative transmission. Under this setting, we formulate a throughput maximization problem to jointly optimize WPT and the relay strategy of the backscatter radios. An iterative algorithm with reduced complexity and communication overhead is proposed to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems distributed at the PBS and the backscatter receiver. Moreover, we take uncertain channel information into consideration and formulate robust counter-parts of the throughput maximization problem when either the backscatter or relay channel is subject to estimation errors. The difficulty of the robust counter-part lies in the coupling of the PBS' power allocation and relay strategy in matrix inequalities, which is addressed by alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results reveal that the cooperative relay strategy of the backscatter radios significantly improves the throughput performance.},

These systems utilize the radio resources and infrastructure of the active radio systems to perform their functionalities. By enabling the dependent coexistence, a new technology named symbiotic radio (SRad) enables the symbiotic relationships between the different radio systems ranging from mutual benefits or competition in terms of sharing the resources, in particular for IoT devices. This survey first provides the motivation for dependent coexistence and background of spectrum sharing through coexistence along with existing literature. Then, it describes the active and passive radio systems definition and a brief overview. Afterward, the history of symbiosis and the role of SRad technology in spectrum sharing and coexistence are defined while focusing on symbiotic communication.

The highly non-convex THPM problem is formulated under requirements for the data rate, the amount of harvested power, and with limited power at the transmitters. First, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and sequential parametric convex approximation are exploited to convert the non-convex THPM to a series of convex subproblems. Then, slack variables replacing interference are introduced to allow decomposing into distributed subproblems via ADMM.The interesting point is that optimal precoding matrices of the local subproblems satisfy the rank-1 constraints of SDR.

For both the proposed schemes, the first stage involves low-complexity coarse-sensing using simple energy detection (ED). The second stage for both methods involve high-performance fine-sensing using beamformed energy detection (BFED) in the estimated direction of arrival (DoA) of the PU signal. In the two-stage method, the second stage is conditional and sensing process goes to the second stage only if certain performance criteria is not met in the first stage. The two proposed methods differ in the performance criteria, which decides if the second stage of BFED is needed or not. The first two-stage method is designed to reduce complexity when there is no PU transmission while the second method is designed to reduce complexity when the PU signal is present. It is shown through simulations that the proposed two-stage schemes have significantly lower complexity as compared to only employing single-stage BFED with little or no performance loss.},

   abstract = {Future wireless networks based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) will offer localization capabilities with centimeter accuracy. We propose to use this inherently obtainable location knowledge to adapt the transceiver to the multipath channel conditions. This saves overhead for channel estimation and dissemination and enables low cost, low complexity and low power data transmission. In particular, we study the location-aware adaptation of generalized energy detection receivers for UWB impulse radio communication with binary pulse position modulation. Conventionally, these receivers are very vulnerable to narrowband interference. Therefore, we derive transmitter and receiver optimization schemes based on the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise- Ratio (SINR): First, we present the SINR optimization based on full channel knowledge. The location knowledge is then incorporated by means of a statistical channel model, which depends on the position of the nodes. Performance evaluation based on a simple channel model is used to give insight about the fundamental behavior of the derived optimization schemes. Moreover, an extensive measurement campaign in a rich scattering environment proves that location information can improve the data transmission and helps to successfully suppress narrowband interference. Performance gains of 2 to 5 dB compared to conventional energy detection can be obtained. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

First, the capacity-achieving distribution is determined for the corresponding channel. For any fixed quantization threshold q it concentrates on the two most distant signaling points, hence leading to an interpretation as binary asymmetric channel. The direct proof of this result allows for an explicit form of the capacity as a function of threshold q. We characterize stationary points as candidates for optimal thresholds by a condition on the differential quotient of the derivative of the binary entropy function.

To characterize the non-coherent decoding performance, a practical upper bound of the average symbol error rate (SER) is derived. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the beamformer at the AP and the phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the average sum-rate of the primary system taking into account the maximum tolerable SER constraint for the SU. To circumvent the couplings of variables, we exploit the Schur complement that facilitates the design of a suboptimal beamforming algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that compared with various benchmark algorithms, the proposed scheme significantly improves the average sum-rate of the primary system, while guaranteeing the decoding performance of the secondary system.},

   abstract = {As communication systems scale up in speed and bandwidth, the cost and power consumption of high-precision (e.g., 8-12 bits) analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) becomes the limiting factor in modern transceiver architectures based on digital signal processing. In this work, we explore the impact of lowering the precision of the ADC on the performance of the communication link. Specifically, we evaluate the communication limits imposed by low-precision ADC (e.g., 1-3 bits) for transmission over the real discrete-time Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, under an average power constraint on the input. For an ADC with K quantization bins (i.e., a precision of log2 K bits), we show that the input distribution need not have any more than k+1 mass points to achieve the channel capacity. For 2-bin (1-bit) symmetric quantization, this result is tightened to show that binary antipodal signaling is optimum for any signalto- noise ratio (SNR). For multi-bit quantization, a dual formulation of the c annel capacity problem is used to obtain tight upper bounds on the capacity. The cutting-plane algorithm is employed to compute the capacity numerically, and the results obtained are used to make the following encouraging observations : (a) up to a moderately high SNR of 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization results in only 10-20% reduction of spectral efficiency compared to unquantized observations, (b) standard equiprobable pulse amplitude modulated i put with quantizer thresholds set to implement maximum likelihood hard decisions is asymptotically optimum at high SNR, and works well at low to moderate SNRs as well.

Unlike a typical DMC channel whose the capacity is a convex function of the input distribution, the capacity of a DMTC is a non-convex function of both the input distribution and decision thresholds. To resolve this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm for approximating the channel capacity of a DMTC using a novel modified k-means algorithm whose computational complexity is reduced by a factor of \frac\{M\}\{\log M\} over the standard k-means algorithm, where M relates to the precision resolution of the solution.

For the considered scenario, we propose three beamformed energy detection (BFED) schemes where beamforming is done in the dominant direction of arrival (DoA) at the SU and then energy detection (ED) is applied. The three schemes differ in the amount of information assumed about the DoAs at the SU. The performance of these schemes has been compared with the traditional ED and maximal ratio combining (MRC) schemes for multiantenna systems. It is shown through simulations that the proposed BFED approaches provide significant performance gains over the ED and negligible loss as compared to the MRC, which makes an impractical assumption of the channel between the PU and the SU to be exactly known.},

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is becoming increasingly popular for enabling green communication amidst the continual development of the Internet-of-things paradigm. Efforts have been put into backscatter signal detection as the detection performance is limited by the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the signal at the receiver. The low SINR can be improved by adopting a multi-antenna receiver. In this paper, the optimum multi-antenna receiver that does not impose any constraints on the types of binary modulation performed by the backscatter device and the waveform used by the ambient source system is studied. The proposed receiver owns a simple structure formed by two beamformers. Bit error rate (BER) performances of the optimum receiver are derived under constant-amplitude ambient signal and Gaussian-distributed ambient signal. Moreover, to facilitate the implementation of the optimum receiver, a simplified receiver is proposed and practical approximations to required beamformers are provided. The derived optimum receiver avoids the complex direct path interference cancellation and coherent reception, but exploits the fact that backscatter signal changes the composite channel impinging at the receiver and the directivity of receiver antenna array. Comparative simulation results show that the performance of the optimum receiver achieves the same performance as the coherent receiver even though it realizes non-coherent reception. The studied receivers provide high flexibility for implementing simple and low-cost receivers in different AmBC systems.},

In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for these tags with three states to improve the throughput of the ambient backscatter communication system.

Unfortunately, when a classical constant false alarm rate approach accounting for ideal-pencil beam pattern is adopted, ambiguities in signal detection could arise due to the presence of side-lobes which can cause non-negligible errors in target detection and ranging. To counteract such effect, in this paper we propose a joint threshold-array design approach, where the antenna characteristics are taken into account to best set the threshold and to guarantee the desired detection and ranging performance at the non-coherent receiver section. In order to consider realistic arrays impairments, we focus our attention on the number of antenna elements and of phase shifter bits used for beamforming as key players in defining a trade-off between structural complexity, well-defined radiation pattern, and localization performance. Simulation and measurement results show that the number of bits per phase shifter can be relaxed in favor of a simpler array design, if the number of antennas is sufficiently high and the side-lobes are kept within a suitable level allowing a desired robustness to interference signals.},

To take full advantage of such IRS-assisted communication systems, both the beamformer at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at the IRS need to be optimally designed. However, thus far, the optimal design is not well understood. In this paper, a point-to-point IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system is investigated. The beamformer at the AP and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency. Two efficient algorithms exploiting fixed point iteration and manifold optimization techniques, respectively, are developed for solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The proposed algorithms not only achieve a higher spectral efficiency but also lead to a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art approach. Simulation results reveal that deploying large-scale IRSs in wireless systems is more efficient than increasing the antenna array size at the AP for enhancing both the spectral and the energy efficiency.},

   abstract = {Traditional passive UHF RFID tags employ either ASK or PSK backscatter modulation to communicate data from memory or sensors on the tag to a remotely-located reader. These simple modulation schemes transfer data at a rate of one bit per symbol period, which for an integrated CMOS tag IC requires an on-chip oscillator with a frequency at least equal to the bit rate. Motivated by the fact that most modern UHF RFID readers already employ I/Q demodulation of the backscattered signal to account for backscatter phase rotation as the tag moves with respect to the reader, we propose a QAM backscatter method using no on-chip inductors that is compatible with a single-chip CMOS tag implementation.With QAM backscatter, tags transmit more than one data bit per symbol period, permitting tag designers to employ a lower power on-chip oscillator operating at a frequency equal to the (lower) symbol rate while maintaining the same data throughput as ASK or PSK, or alternatively to send data at a higher rate for a given on-chip oscillator frequency. We present the fundamental design equations required for arbitrary QAM backscatter modulators and present simulated bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) curves for the operation of an inductor-free 4-QAM and 8-QAM modulator centered at 915MHz and evaluated over the 860MHz-950MHz worldwide UHF band. ©2010 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a novel analog-digital hybrid null-steering beamformer which allows the backscatter receiver to detect and decode the weak AmBC-modulated signal buried in the strong direct path signals and the noise, without requiring the instantaneous channel state information. The analog cancellation of the strong signal components allows the receiver automatic gain control to adjust to the level of the weak AmBC signals. This hence allows common analog-to-digital converters to be used for sampling the signal. After cancelling the strong components, the ambient source signal appears as zero mean fast fading from the AmBC system point of view. We use the direct path signal component to track the phase of the unknown ambient signal. In order to avoid channel estimation, we propose AmBC to use orthogonal channelization codes. The results show that the design allows the AmBC receiver to detect the backscatter binary phase shift keying signals without decoding the ambient signals and requiring knowledge of the instantaneous channel state information.},

The primary transmitter (PT) is designed to assist both the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver (PR) is used to decode the information from the PT as well as the BD. The symbol period for BD transmission is assumed to be either equal to or much greater than that of the primary one, resulting in parasitic SR (PSR) or commensal SR (CSR) setup. We consider a basic SR system which consists of three nodes: 1) a multiantenna PT; 2) a single-antenna BD; and 3) a single-antenna PR. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary and BD transmissions for each setup. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and the transmit power minimization (TPM) problem, and solve these nonconvex problems by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. The simulation results show that for CSR setup, the proposed solution enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering without any loss in spectral efficiency, by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.},

The MIMO SWIPT design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in which system sum rate is optimized considering per-user harvesting constraints. Two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is based on a classical gradient-based method for constrained optimization. The second approach is based on difference of convex (DC) programming. The idea behind this approach is to obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then, solve a series of convex subproblems that, eventually, will provide a (locally) optimum solution of the general nonconvex problem. The solution obtained from the proposed approach is compared to the classical block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex multiuser MIMO network by forcing no inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves both the system sum rate and the power harvested by users simultaneously. In terms of computational time, the proposed DC programming outperforms the classical gradient methods.},

At the receiving end, the higher power signal is detected first via the received signal. Next, signal from other antenna is detected by using the first detected signal. Since the backscatter technique generally uses energy detection, it has a low data rate using a single antenna.

For the special case with two users, we further show that the original nonconvex TPM problem can be equivalently transferred into a convex optimization problem and easily solved via standard optimization tools. In addition, the optimal beamforming is also characterized in a closed form and we show that it achieves the same performance as the DPC. In the simulation, we show that our proposed optimal NOMA beamforming outperforms OMA schemes and can even achieve the same performance as DPC.

   abstract = {In recent years, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique has been at the center of some of very exciting developments in the area of signal processing and communications, and it has shown great significance and relevance on a variety of applications. Roughly speaking, SDR is a powerful, computationally efficient approximation technique for a host of very difficult optimization problems. In particular, it can be applied to many nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) in an almost mechanical fashion, including the following problem: min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFi x \{\$\} gi, i51,c, p, xTHi x5li, i51,c, q, (1) where the given matrices C, F1,c, Fp, H1,c, Hq are assumed to be general real symmetric matrices, possibly indefinite. The class of nonconvex QCQPs (1) captures many problems that are of interest to the signal processing and communications community. For instance, consider the Boolean quadratic program (BQP) min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xi 2 51, i51,c, n. (2) The BQP is long known to be a computationally difficult problem. In particular, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, being able to handle the BQP well has an enormous impact on multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) detection and multiuser detection. Another important yet NP-hard problem in the nonconvex QCQP class (1) is min x[Rn xTCx s.t. xTFix \{\$\} 1, i51,c, m, (3) where C, F1,c, Fm are all positive semidefinite. Problem (3) captures the multicast downlink transmit beamforming problem; see [1] for details. An illustration of an instance of (3) is provided in Figure 1. As seen from the figure, the feasible set of (3) is the intersection of the exteriors of multiple ellipsoids, which makes the problem difficult. As a matter of fact, SDR has been studied and applied in the optimization community long before it made its impact on signal processing and communications. The idea of SDR can be found in an early paper of Lovász in 1979 [2], but it was arguably the seminal work of Goemans and Williamson in 1995 [3] that sparked the significant interest in and rapid development of SDR techniques. In that work, it was shown that SDR can be used to provide an approximation accuracy of no worse than 0.8756 for the maximum cut problem (the BQP with some conditions on C). In other words, even though the maximum cut problem is NP-hard, one could efficiently obtain a solution whose objective value is at least 0.8756 times the optimal value using SDR. Since then, we have seen a number of dedicated theoretical analyses that establish the SDR approximation accuracy under different problem settings [3]–[11] and that have greatly improved our understanding of the capabilities of SDR. Today, we are even able to pin down a number of conditions under which SDR provides an exact optimal solution to the original problem [7], [12]–[16].},

The state-of-the-art approach utilizes the structured channel sparsity by sampling the angular-domain channel representation with a uniform angle-sampling grid, a.k.a. virtual channel representation. However, this approach is only applicable to uniform linear arrays and may cause a substantial performance loss due to the mismatch between the virtual representation and the true angle information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse channel representation with a super-resolution sampling grid and a hidden Markovian support. Based on this, we develop a novel approximate inference based blind estimation algorithm to estimate the channel and the user signals simultaneously, with emphasis on the adoption of the expectation-maximization method to learn the angle information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the low-complexity implementation of our algorithm, making use of factor graph and message passing principles to compute the marginal posteriors. Numerical results show that our proposed method significantly reduces the estimation error compared to the state-of-the-art approach under various settings, which verifies the efficiency and robustness of our method.},

However, the extension of this algorithm to the computation of capacity regions of multiterminal networks is not straightforward since it gives rise to non-convex problems. In this context, the AB algorithm has only been successfully extended to the calculation of the sum-capacity of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DMAC). Thus, the computation of the whole capacity region still requires the use of computationally demanding search methods. In this paper, we first give an alternative reformulation of the capacity region of the DMAC which condenses all the nonconvexities of the problem into a single rank-one constraint. Then, we propose efficient methods to compute outer and inner bounds on the capacity region of the two-user DMAC by solving a relaxed version of the problem and projecting its solution onto the original feasible set. Targeting numerical results, we first take a randomization approach. Focusing on analytical results, we study projection via minimum divergence, which amounts to the marginalization of the relaxed solution. In this case we derive sufficient conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounds to be tight. Furthermore, we are able to show that the class of channels for which the marginalization bounds match exactly the capacity region includes all the two-user binaryinput deterministic DMACs as well as other non-deterministic channels. In general, however, both methods are able to compute very tight bounds as shown for various examples.},

The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the total harvested power at energy harvesting receivers subject to minimumrequired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at multiple information receivers. We transform the considered non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) is solved optimally by SDP relaxation. Numerical results unveil a substantial performance gain that can be achieved if the resource allocation design is based on the proposed non-linear energy harvesting model instead of the traditional linear model.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap the promising gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential, whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance of IRS-aided multiuser communications with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection coefficients of the IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Next, for the single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users\{\&\}\{\#\}x2019; weighted sum-rate. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control (with/without the conventional phase-shift control) on the system performance under imperfect CSI.},

   abstract = {While two-way communication can improve the spectral efficiency of wireless networks, distances from the relay to the two users are usually asymmetric, leading to excessive wireless energy at the nearby user. To exploit the excessive energy, energy harvesting at user terminals is a viable option. Unfortunately, the exact gain brought by wireless power transfer (WPT) in two-way communication is currently unknown. To fill this gap, in this paper, the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication with a fixed relay is derived. Not only this newly established result is shown to enclose the existing achievable rate region of two-way relay channel without energy harvesting but also the gain is precisely quantified. On the other hand, it is well-known that a major obstacle to WPT is the path-loss. By endowing the relay with mobility, the distances between the relay and users can be varied, thus providing a potential solution to combat pathloss at the expense of energy for transmission. To characterize the consequence brought by such a scheme, a pair of inner and outer bounds to the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication under a mobile relay is further derived. By comparing the exact achievable rate region for the fixed relay case and the achievable rate bounds for the mobile relay case, it is possible to quantify the relative advantage of spending energy on moving versus on transmission in wirelessly powered two-way communication.},

   abstract = {User pairing in Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access (NOMA) uplink based on channel state information is investigated considering some predefined power allocation schemes. The base station divides the set of users into disjunct pairs and assigns the available resources to these pairs. The combinatorial problem of user pairing to achieve the maximum sum rate is analyzed in the large system limit for various scenarios, and some optimum and sub-optimum algorithms with a polynomial-time complexity are proposed. In the first scenario, 2M users and the base station have a single-antenna and communicate over M subcarriers. The performance of optimum pairing is derived for M → ∞ and shown to be superior to random pairing and orthogonal multiple access techniques. In the second setting, a novel NOMA scheme for a multi-antenna base station and single carrier communication is proposed. In this case, the users need not be aware of the pairing strategy. Furthermore, the proposed NOMA scheme is generalized to multi-antenna users. It is shown that random and optimum user pairing perform similarly in the large system limit, but optimum pairing is significantly better in finite dimensions. It is shown that the proposed NOMA scheme outperforms a previously proposed NOMA scheme with signal alignment.},

In particular, the multicast subscribers are served as secondary users underlaying a primary user. To enhance the secondary user fairness and compensate for the primary user, a two-stage cooperative strategy is proposed by selecting a certain secondary user to perform NOMA transmission distributedly. The maximum ratio combining (MRC) is further employed to harvest spatial diversity. We explicitly formulate the primary outage probability and secondary ergodic throughput in closed form. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic expressions and accordingly investigate the power allocation optimization with a primary outage constraint to maximize the secondary throughput.

In the uplink transmission, a backscatter tag modulates signals from a Wi-Fi access point by backscattering. Since the reflection occurs, the backscattered signal experiences more attenuation than the direct Wi-Fi signals to a Wi-Fi reader. Most recent studies focus on effective detection techniques to increase the coverage of the backscatter tag in the poor signal to interference plus noise ratio environment. This paper proposes an improved detection scheme using multiple antennas at the reader. At the reader, the backscattered signals are received by multiple antennas and thresholds are determined appropriately for improvement of detection performance. Typically the methods using multiple antennas require channel information. However the channel estimation for the uplink of backscatter system is difficult since the backscattered signals are weak. The detection method of this paper does not require the channel information for the uplink. Simulation results show improved performance and possibility for the increase of coverage.},

   abstract = {A new line of research on communications and signals design for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature. Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and a combination thereof. To a great extent, the study of those strategies has so far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end, we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight that a channeladaptive WPT architecture based on joint beamforming and waveform design offers significant performance improvements in harvested DC power over conventional single-antenna/multiantenna continuous wave systems. The experimental results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester nonlinearity.},

   abstract = {Green low power networking with the least requirement of dedicated radio resources is need of the hour which has led to the upsurge of backscatter communication (BSC) technology. However, this inherent potential of BSC is challenged by hardware constraints of the underlying tags. We address this timely concern by investigating the practical efficacy of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology in overcoming the fundamental limitations of BSC. Specifically, we first introduce a novel least-squares based channel estimation (CE) protocol for multi-tag BSC settings that takes care of both the unintended ambient reflections and the inability of tags in performing estimation by themselves. Then using it, a nontrivial low-complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transceiver designs for the multiantenna reader to maximize the minimum value of the lower-bounded backscattered throughput among the single-antenna semi-passive tags. Additional analytical insights on both individually and jointly-optimal precoding vector and detector matrix at the reader are provided by exploring the asymptotically-optimal transceiver designs. Lastly detailed numerical investigation is carried out to validate the theoretical results and quantify the practically realizable throughput fairness. Specifically, more than seven-fold increase in the common-backscattered-throughput among tags as achieved by the proposed designs over the relevant benchmarks corroborates their practical significance.},

This process often involves solving sim-ilar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under stringent time requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this solution process to directly learn the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters, thus reducing the need of solving computationally expensive large-scale paramet-ric programs in real time. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active con-straints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables more interpretable learning poli-cies, and inherently accounts for relevant safety constraints. Further, the number of relevant ac-tive sets is finite, which make them simpler ob-jects to learn. To learn the relevant active sets, we propose a streaming algorithm backed up by the-oretical results. Through extensive experiments on benchmarks of the Optimal Power Flow prob-lem, we observe that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that this is the appropriate level of abstraction for a learning al-gorithm to target.},

   abstract = {Most problems in frequentist statistics involve optimization of a function such as a likelihood or a sum of squares. EM algorithms are among the most effective algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation because they consistently drive the likelihood uphill by maximizing a simple surrogate function for the log-likelihood. Iterative optimization of a surrogate function as exemplified by an EM algorithm does not necessarily require missing data. Indeed, every EM algorithm is a special case of the more general class of MM optimization algorithms, which typically exploit convexity rather than missing data in majorizing or minorizing an objective function. In our opinion, MM algorithms deserve to be part of the standard toolkit of professional statisticians. This article explains the principle behind MM algorithms, suggests some methods for constructing them, and discusses some of their attractive features. We include numerous examples throughout the article to illustrate the concepts described. In addition to surveying previous work on MM algorithms, this article introduces some new material on constrained optimization and standard error estimation. © 2004 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.},

   abstract = {Backscatter modulation (BM), usually used for radio frequency identifications, has the potential to be exploited in a wider range of applications such as the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we leverage the BM by increasing its down-link (from reader to tag) and up-link (from tag to reader) ranges. We propose two active two-way BM tag configurations, named parallel and series. For both configurations, we use active loads in the tag modulators to maximize the BM range and implement the desired backscattered constellation, subject to no data loss in the down-link path. Contrary to most existing BM studies, we use Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuit, only to calculate the received power at tag, while we derive the tag backscattered power using the antenna scatterer theorem. Moreover, we obtain a closed-form expression of the average bit error probability (BEP) at the reader in Rician fading channel environment for both tag configurations. We compare the proposed active BM tags with the conventional passive BM tags. The simulation results prove that for an average BEP equal to 10-4, an SNR improvement of up to 19 and 24 dB can be achieved for parallel and series configurations, respectively.},

   abstract = {Energy harvesting for wireless communication networks is a new paradigm that allows terminals to recharge their batteries from external energy sources in the surrounding environment. A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This article provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space. The article also discusses the benefits of a potential integration of SWIPT technologies in modern communication networks in the context of resource allocation and cooperative cognitive radio networks.},

In particular, we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacityachieving input distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with a finite number of mass points. Our numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.},

   abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new frequency domain non-orthogonal multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve link-adaptation as a result of less colored interference. In this paper a technique is developed to enable multi-user SCMA (MU-SCMA) for downlink wireless access. User pairing, power sharing, rate adjustment, and scheduling algorithms are designed to improve the downlink throughput of a heavily loaded network. The advantage of SCMA spreading for lightly loaded networks is also evaluated.},

In this paper, we model a cooperative AmBC system from a spectrum- sharing perspective, where a cooperative receiver (C-RX) decodes the information from both a multi-antenna primary transmitter (PT) and a single-antenna secondary transmitter (i.e., tag). We consider two scenarios: first, the tag-symbol period equals the PT-symbol period; second, the tag-symbol period is an integer multiple of the PT-symbol period. For each scenario, we analyze the data rate via successive- interference-cancellation (SIC) based decoding, and formulate a problem to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the beamforming vector at the PT. The problems are transformed into semi-definite programming (SDP), and solved by using the technique of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Furthermore, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of beamforming optimization. Numerical results show that the cooperative AmBC system can achieve a higher sum rate than a conventional point-to-point system without a backscatter tag.},

The phase shifts at the IRS are optimized jointly with the transmit beamforming vector of the carrier emitter to minimize the transmit power consumption at the carrier emitter whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. The unique channel characteristics arising from multiple reflections at the IRS render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we jointly utilize the minorization-maximization algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation technique to present an approximate solution for the optimal IRS phase shift design. We also extend our analytical results to the monostatic BackCom system. Numerical results indicate that the introduction of the IRS brings about considerable reductions in transmit power, even with moderate IRS sizes, which can be translated to range increases over the non-IRS-assisted BackCom system.},

In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes. In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key parameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and condition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.},

In a conventional RF-powered CRN, the secondary system works based on the harvest-then-transmit protocol. That is, the secondary transmitter (ST) harvests energy from primary signals and then uses the harvested energy to transmit data to its secondary receiver (SR). However, with this protocol, the performance of the secondary system is much dependent on the amount of harvested energy as well as the primary channel activity, e.g., idle and busy periods. Recently, ambient backscatter communication has been introduced, which enables the ST to transmit data to the SR by backscattering ambient signals. Therefore, it is potential to be adopted in the RF-powered CRN. We investigate the performance of RF-powered CRNs with ambient backscatter communication over two scenarios, i.e., overlay and underlay CRNs. For each scenario, we formulate and solve the optimization problem to maximize the overall transmission rate of the secondary system. Numerical results show that by incorporating such two techniques, the performance of the secondary system can be improved significantly compared with the case when the ST performs either harvest-then-transmit or ambient backscatter technique.},

Recently, a new technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed to exploit the benefits and address the drawbacks of cognitive radio (CR) and ambient backscattering communications (AmBC), leading to mutualism spectrum sharing and highly reliable backscattering communications. In particular, the secondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based on cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares not only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the primary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial multipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form mutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at SRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. In this article, to exploit the full potential of SR, we provide a systematic view for SR and address three fundamental tasks in SR: (1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly reliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF signals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

At the first mini-slot of these cooperative schemes, each user transmits its signal and receives the transmitted signal of the other user, and at the second mini-slot, each user relays the other user's message with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. To achieve better spectral efficiency, users transmit their signals in non-orthogonal mode in both mini-slots. We propose two detection schemes for these proposed cooperative (C)-NOMA and cooperative-rate-splitting-multiple-access (C-RSMA) schemes in which we apply a combination of maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) and successive-interference-cancellation (SIC). Finally, we derive the achievable rates corresponding to the C-NOMA and C-RSMA schemes. Simulation results prove the superiority of the proposed C-NOMA and C-RSMA schemes rather than cooperative-orthogonal-multiple-access (C-OMA) and non-cooperative schemes.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have confirmed the adverse impact of fading correlation on the mutual information (MI) of two-dimensional (2D) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. More recently, the trend is to enhance the system performance by exploiting the channels degrees of freedom in the elevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this paper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function (SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. The proposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane waves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary angular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS) coefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment. The developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the receiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the effects of correlation on system performance, the information-theoretic deterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in both mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed analytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance on azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful insights into the behavior of MI as a function of downtilt angles are provided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D MIMO channels in the future.},

The vision of massive IoT, involving billions of smart objects to be connected to the cellular network, needs to address the problem of uninterrupted power consumption while taking advantage of emerging high-frequency 5G communications. The problem of limited battery power motivates us to utilize radio frequency (RF) signals as the energy source for battery-free communications in next-generation wireless networks. Backscatter communication (BackCom) makes it possible to harvest energy from incident RF signals and reflect back parts of the same signals while modulating the data. Ambient BackCom (Amb-BackCom) is a type of BackCom that can harvest energy from nearby WiFi, TV, and cellular RF signals to modulate information. The objective of this article is to review BackCom as a solution to the limited battery life problem and enable future battery-free communications for combating the energy issues for devices in emerging wireless networks. We first highlight the energy constraint in existing wireless communications. We then investigate BackCom as a practical solution to the limited battery life problem. Subsequently, in order to take the advantages of omnipresent radio waves, we elaborate BackCom tag architecture and various types of BackCom. To understand encoding and data extraction, we demonstrate signal processing aspects that cover channel coding, interference, decoding, and signal detection schemes. Moreover, we also describe BackCom communication modes, modulation schemes, and multiple access techniques to accommodate maximum users with high throughput. Similarly, to mitigate the increased network energy, adequate data and power transfer schemes for BackCom are elaborated, in addition to reliability, security, and range extension. Finally, we highlight BackCom applications with existing research challenges and future directions for next-generation 5G wireless networks.},

In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multicarrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely, modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multicarrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multicarrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a nonzero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-Achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multicarrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

In this letter, we propose a practical transmission protocol to execute channel estimation and reflection optimization successively for an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Under the unit-modulus constraint, a novel reflection pattern at the IRS is designed to aid the channel estimation at the access point (AP) based on the received pilot signals from the user, for which the channel estimation error is derived in closed-form. With the estimated CSI, the reflection coefficients are then optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the resolved strongest signal path in the time domain.

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technique for future wireless communication networks. How to reliably transmit information in a RIS-based communication system arouses much interest. This paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based communications, where both the reflecting patterns and transmit signals can carry information. Depending on that the transmitter and RIS jointly or independently deliver information, RM is further classified into two categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting (DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the proposed system optimization methods considerably outperform existing schemes in BER.},

A practical transmission protocol is proposed to execute channel estimation and passive beamforming successively. To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NP-hard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results are presented to show the significant rate improvement of our proposed IRS training reflection pattern and passive beamforming designs as compared to other benchmark schemes.},

A non-orthogonal-multiple-access enhanced dynamic-time-division-multiple-access (NOMA-DTDMA) transmission scheme is proposed to exploit the channel dynamics and further improve the spectrum efficiency.

An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex problem, by utilizing the block coordinated descent and successive convex optimization techniques. The convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm are also analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-DTDMA scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark scheme of dynamic TDMA in terms of both throughput performance and BD fairness.

We show that the arithmetic complexity of this problem is bounded by O(n3+(n log2 n) log b). If the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the matrix A coincide with each other (which is the case for genetic matrices of all classes of general and special matrices that we consider), then the latter deterministic cost bound can be replaced by the randomized bound O(KA(2n)+n2+(n log2 n) log b) where KA(2n) denotes the cost of the computation of the 2n-1 vectors Aiv, i = 1,...,2n-1, maximized over all n-dimensional vectors v; KA(2n) = O(M(n) log n), for M(n) = o(n2.376) denoting the arithmetic complexity of n×n matrix multiplication. This bound on the complexity of the eigenproblem is optimal up to a logarithmic factor and implies much faster solution of the eigenproblem for the important special classes of matrices. In particular, we prove the bound O(n2 log n+(n log2 n) log b) on the randomized arithmetic complexity of the eigenproblem for generic matrices of the classes of n×n Toeplitz, Hankel, Toeplitz-like, Hankel-like and Toeplitz-like-plus-Hankel-like matrices. Then again, this bound is optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) for each of the latter classes of input matrices. We also prove similar nearly optimal upper bounds for the generic Cauchy-like, Vandermonde-like and sparse matrices.

Initial work on ambient backscatter shows promising results but has focused on narrow band operation in well controlled laboratory settings. The goal of this work is to enable the ubiquitous deployment of ultra-low power nodes that communicate via ambient backscatter to wired Universal Backscatter Readers, in real-world environments. This is accomplished through ultra-wideband backscatter techniques that leverage the breath of commercial broadcast signals in the 80 MHz to 900 MHz range from FM radios, digital TVs, and cellular networks. Additionally the use of powered Universal Backscatter Readers allows a network of ultra-low power nodes to operate on ambient carriers as low as -80 dBm, which is typical for indoor home and office environments. For the first time we demonstrate the simultaneous use of 17 ambient signal sources to achieve node-to-reader communication distances of 50 meters, with data rates up to 1 kbps.},

This paper first establishes a model enabling a thorough analysis of the multisine-based WPT system focusing on the bandwidth of the signal and the rectifier. This model enables a codesign of signal and rectifier for optimal WPT. The proposed model provides insight into the output voltage and power, as a function of the input waveform for different circuit models. By including the input matching and the clamper, our model is generic and can include a wide range of rectifiers with different voltage multiplication approaches. The key insight gained from our analysis is that there is a tradeoff between the frequency spacing of the tones of the multisine signal and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass RC filter, as a main property of the rectifier circuit. Our model predicts the measured power conversion efficiency and voltage with an error below 0.1 and 0.2 V, respectively.},

   abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things. Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have the potential to transform wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation environments. To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large, especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations for the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply to an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the best transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired quality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We consider an exemplary downlink system and study the minimization of the base station (BS) transmit power subject to QoS constraints for the users. Since the resulting mixed-integer programming problem for joint optimization of the BS beamforming vectors and the tile transmission modes is non-convex, we derive two efficient suboptimal solutions, which are based on alternating optimization and a greedy approach, respectively.

   abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) comprised of tunable unit cells have recently drawn significant attentions due to their superior capability in manipulating electromagnetic waves. In particular, RIS-assisted wireless communications have the great potential to achieve significant performance improvement and coverage enhancement in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner, by properly programming the reflection coefficients of the unit cells of RISs. In this paper, the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications are developed for different scenarios by studying the physics and electromagnetic nature of RISs. The proposed models, which are first validated through extensive simulation results, reveal the relationships between the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications and the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the size of the RIS, the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, and the radiation patterns of antennas and unit cells. In addition, three fabricated RISs (metasurfaces) are utilized to further corroborate theoretical findings through experimental measurements conducted in a microwave anechoic chamber. The measurement results match well with the modeling results, thus validating the proposed free-space path loss models for RIS, which may pave the way for further theoretical studies and practical applications in this field.},

   abstract = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band has been utilized in the IEEE 802.11ad standard to achieve multi-Gbps throughput. Despite the advantages, mmWave links are highly vulnerable to both user and environmental mobility. Since mmWave radios use highly directional antennas, the line-of-sight (LOS) signal can be easily blocked by various obstacles, such as walls, furniture, and humans. In the complicated indoor environment, it is highly possible that the blocked mmWave link cannot be restored no matter how the access point and the mobile user change their antenna directions. To address the problem and enable indoor mobile mmWave networks, in this paper, we introduce the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-arrays to establish robust mmWave connections for indoor networks even when the links are blocked by obstructions. First, the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-array is designed, implemented, and modeled. Then a three-party beam-searching protocol is designed for reflect-array-assisted 802.11ad networks. Finally, an optimal array deployment strategy is developed to minimize the link outage probability in indoor mobile mmWave networks. The proposed solution is validated and evaluated by both in-lab experiments and computer simulations.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of wireless propagation environment has recently emerged as a promising cost-effective technology for boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the ideal phase shift model assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of its phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this paper the practical phase shift model that captures the phase-dependent amplitude variation in the element-wise reflection coefficient. Based on the proposed model and considering an IRS-aided multiuser system with an IRS deployed to assist in the downlink communications from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly designing the AP transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming, subject to the users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions to this problem efficiently by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) or penalty-based optimization technique. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance loss of the IRS-aided system that employs practical phase shifters but assumes the ideal phase shift model for beamforming optimization, as the number of IRS elements goes to infinity. Simulation results unveil substantial performance gains achieved by the proposed beamforming optimization based on the practical phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

In the literature, different models have been proposed mainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH. Due to the complexity of the proposed nonlinear models, obtaining analytical optimal or well performing signal designs have been extremely challenging. Relying on the proposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design for simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power demand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the origin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme case of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off keying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side, for relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver power demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas the others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with different phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the modulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.},

In the proposed system, the base station (BS) transmits information to two cellular users according to the NOMA protocol, while a BD transmits its information over the BS signals to one cellular user using the passive radio technology. In particular, if the BS only serves the cellular user that decodes BD information, the backscatter-NOMA system turns into a symbiotic radio (SR) system. We derive the expressions of the outage probabilities and the ergodic rates and analyze the corresponding diversity orders and slopes for both backscatter-NOMA and SR systems. Finally, we provide the numerical results to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the interrelationship between the cellular networks and the IoT networks.},

In this paper, we consider a cooperative cognitive backscatter network (CCBN) consisting of a multi-antenna RF-Source, multiple (ambient) BDs, and a multi-antenna cooperative receiver (C-RX). We derive the achievable rates for the C-RX decoding the direct-link signal from the RF-Source and the backscatter-link signal from all BDs, respectively. We further formulate an optimization problem to maximize the backscatter-link sum rate by optimizing the beamforming weights (i.e., the precoding matrix) subject to the RF-Source's minimum rate requirement and the BDs' minimum energy requirements. Based on the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method, we propose an algorithm to find the optimal solution to the original non-convex problem, by using a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems to approximate the original problem iteratively. Finally, extensive numerical results show that the optimal beamforming solution enhances the BDs' sum rate significantly compared to the omnidirectional transmission, and demonstrate the tradeoff among the direct-link rate of the RF-Source, the sum rate of all BDs, as well as the energy requirements at the BDs.},

   abstract = {This two-part paper develops novel methodologies for using fractional programming (FP) techniques to design and optimize communication systems. Part I of this paper proposes a new quadratic transform for FP and treats its application for continuous optimization problems. In this Part II of the paper, we study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are considerably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete or mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex problems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete variables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable to distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this methodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink coordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink scheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user scheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby cells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly with continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The main idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the interfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of the discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper shows that the well-known weighted minimum meansquare-error (WMMSE) algorithm can also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based method significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables are involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.},

Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is intractable in all but the simplest cases. The present work proposes a new paradigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and, subsequently, optimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting waves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their macro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable wireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or polarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices. Realistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of the proposed approach in 2.4GHz and 60GHz frequencies.},

   abstract = {This work investigates the energy-efficient resource allocation for layered-division multiplexing (LDM) based non-orthogonal multicast and unicast transmission in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where each user equipment (UE) performs wireless information and power transfer simultaneously. To begin with, the achievable data rates for multicast and unicast services are derived in closed form, as well as the received radio frequency (RF) power at each UE. Based on the analytical results, a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem for energy efficiency (EE) maximization is formulated, which is however a challenging fractional programming problem with complex constraints. To suit the massive access setting, a first-order algorithm is developed to find both initial feasible point and the nearly optimal solution. Moreover, an accelerated algorithm is designed to improve the convergence speed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed first-order algorithms can achieve almost the same EE as that of second-order approaches yet with much lower computational complexity, which provides insight into the superiority of the proposed algorithms for massive access in cell-free massive MIMO systems.},

This paper proposes a novel MFSK modulation for the Tag of ambient backscatter communications systems, and the corresponding detectors are designed depending on the capability of the Reader. In the case the Reader is not capable of removing the direct interference from the ambient source, a maximum likelihood detector is proposed. In another case, leveraging on the frequency shift feature of the MFSK modulation, the Reader can remove the direct interference. Then, a simple energy detector is proposed, and the closed-form expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability of the system are derived. The findings of this paper suggest that the proposed MFSK modulation outperforms the popular ON-OFF keying modulation, and the impact of modulation order on the SER performance depends heavily on the operating bit signal to noise ratio. Moreover, it is shown that it is desirable to place the Tag close to the Reader in terms of minimizing the outage probability.},

Backscatter modulation allows a remote device to wirelessly transfer information without requiring a traditional transceiver. Instead, a backscatter device leverages a carrier transmitted by an access point or base station. Nevertheless, the traditional approach is to use amplitude shift keying or phase shift keying backscatter solutions which limits the data rate of the sensors, since it transfers only one bit per symbol period. We propose a novel modulator, which employs a Wilkinson power divider with a phase shift in one of the design branch and two transistors acting as switches in order to generate M-quadrature amplitude modulation backscatter modulation. The design strategy for high level order backscatter modulations will be explained and a design approach will be presented in this manuscript.},

This passive sensing approach allows a backscatter sensor node (BSN) to transmit information by reflecting the incident signal from a carrier emitter without initiating its transmission. To multiplex multiple BSNs, power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is fully exploited in this work. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of a NOMA enhanced bistatic BackCom system for a battery-less smart communication paradigm. Specifically, we derive the closed-form bit error rate (BER) expressions for a cluster of two devices in a bistatic BackCom system employing NOMA with imperfect successive interference cancellation under Nakagami- $\{m\}$ fading channel. The obtained expressions are utilized to evaluate the reflection coefficients of devices needed for the most favorable system performance along with the performance comparison with orthogonal multiple access-time domain multiple access scheme (OMA-TDMA).},

In this letter, we solve the total rate maximization problem for a multi-carrier wireless powered BackCom network, where a dedicated radio frequency power source (PS) transmits multi-carrier signals to a hybrid Information transceiver device (iTD) during energy harvesting (EH) phase, and then the ITD deliveries the signals to the associated receiver during the Information transmission (iT) phase. Our goal Is to maximize the sum rate of the backscatter data rate and the transmission rate during the IT phase by jointly optimizing power allocation, time allocation, reflection coefficient, energy allocation coefficient, where the maximum transmit power constraint at the PS and the minimum circuit power consumption constraint are considered. Then an Iterative RA algorithm Is developed to find the optimal solutions. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme In terms of transmission rates.},

Leveraging a small-signal model for a nonlinear energy harvester, a general form of the delivered power in terms of system baseband parameters is derived, which demonstrates the dependency of the delivered power on higher moments of the baseband channel input. The optimization problem of maximizing rate-power (RP) region is studied. Assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is available at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to the non-zero mean Gaussian input distributions, an optimization algorithm for power allocation among different subchannels is studied. As a special case, optimality conditions for zero mean Gaussian inputs are derived. Results obtained from the numerical optimization demonstrate the superiority of the non-zero mean Gaussian inputs (with asymmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) in yielding a larger RP region compared to their zero mean and non-zero mean (with symmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) counterparts. The results motivate the design of new modulation for SWIPT and contrast with the SWIPT design under linear energy harvesting, for which the circularly symmetric Gaussian inputs with water-filling power allocation are optimal.},

Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation.

We discuss their principles, key features, and pros/cons, and then provide a comprehensive comparison of these solutions from the perspective of spectral efficiency, system performance, receiver complexity, and so on. In addition, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for NOMA design are highlighted to provide some insight on the potential future work for researchers in this field. Finally, to leverage different multiple access schemes including both conventional OMA and new NOMA, we propose the concept of software defined multiple access (SoDeMA), which enables adaptive configuration of available multiple access schemes to support diverse services and applications in future 5G networks.},

   abstract = {Link adaptation techniques, where the modulation, coding rate, and/or other signal transmission parameters are dynamically adapted to the changing channel conditions, have recently emerged as powerful tools for increasing the data rate and spectral efficiency of wireless datacentric networks. While there has been significant progress on understanding the theoretical aspects of time adaptation in LA protocols, new challenges surface when dynamic transmission techniques are employed in broadband wireless networks with multiple signaling dimensions. Those additional dimensions are mainly frequency, especially in multicarrier systems, and space in multiple-antenna systems, particularly multi-array multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. In this article we give an overview of the challenges and promises of link adaptation in future broadband wireless networks. We suggest guidelines to help in the design of robust, complexity/cost-effective algorithms for these future wireless networks.},

Recent advances in backscatter communication have enabled ubiquitous IoT devices to communicate in a cost-and power-efficient way. However, most of the proposed backscatter solutions nowadays focus on the single tag paradigm, i.e., multiple tags do not transmit simultaneously and thus the solutions have difficulties to scale with a large number of tags. This work presents CBMA, a backscatter system that enables multiple concurrent backscatter tags to communicate reliably and efficiently. For the first time, we demonstrate that multiple tags can backscatter concurrently and efficiently with novel impedance-based power control at the tag, and can be successfully decoded with commodity WiFi devices without affecting the existing WiFi communication. We present the design details of CBMA and build a prototype with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and FPGA. The CBMA system achieves a 10-tag bit rate of 8Mbps while supporting a communication distance up to 10m. Compared to single-tag solutions, CBMA improves the backscatter throughput by more than 10× even in challenging indoor scenarios with rich multipath and interference.},

A new co-operative SWIPT NOMA protocol is proposed, in which near NOMA users that are close to the source act as energy harvesting relays to help far NOMA users. Since the locations of users have a significant impact on the performance, three user selection schemes based on the user distances from the base station are proposed. To characterize the performance of the proposed selection schemes, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and system throughput are derived. These analytical results demonstrate that the use of SWIPT will not jeopardize the diversity gain compared to the conventional NOMA. The proposed results confirm that the opportunistic use of node locations for user selection can achieve low outage probability and deliver superior throughput in comparison to the random selection scheme.},

As a result, conventional wireless devices can receive these backscattered signals without any modification (neither hardware nor software) to the conventional wireless device. We present a proof of concept using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, or BLE, standard widely available on smart phones and mobile devices. Our prototype backscatter tag produces three-channel bandpass frequency shift keying (FSK) packets at 1 Mbps that are indistinguishable from conventional BLE advertising packets. An unmodified Apple iPad is shown to correctly receive and display these packets at a range of over 9.4 m using its existing iOS Bluetooth stack with no changes whatsoever. We create all three BLE channels by backscattering a single incident CW carrier using a novel combination of fundamentalmode and harmonic-mode backscatter subcarrier modulation, with two of the band-pass channels generated by the fundamental mode and one of the band-pass channels generated by the second harmonic mode. The backscatter modulator consumes only 28.4 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional BLE transmitters. The backscatter approach yields over 100X lower energy per bit than a conventional BLE transmitter, while retaining compatibility with billions of existing Bluetooth enabled smartphones and mobile devices.},

This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.},

We capitalize the fact that the two communications technologies can complement each other in a hybrid radio network, by proposing the passive relaying scheme for active RF communications. Specifically, each active RF radio is allocated a fixed time slot for its data transmission. It is also assisted by a set of passive radios via backscattering the RF signals of the active radio. Though passive relaying is energy efficient as it consumes minuscule amount of energy in backscatter communications, it indeed competes the channel time that can be used by the passive radios to harvest RF energy. We propose a game-theoretic approach to balance energy harvesting and relaying performance, by allowing each passive radio to iteratively optimize its reflection coefficients.

In this paper, a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered, which improves the SWIPT rate-energy trade-off region significantly. The nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver. The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.},

In this paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase, where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose an low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem.

   abstract = {This paper investigates the secure transmit design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system under the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model, where a transmitter sends confidential information and transfers energy to multiple information receivers (IRs) and EH receivers (ERs) with the existence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). To prevent confidential information leakage, multiple artificial redundant signals (MARSs) are embedded in the transmit signals. The goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and the covariance matrixes of MARSs, such that the minimal information rate and EH requirements at IRs and ERs are guaranteed while making the received signal-to-Interference ratio at ERs and Eves lower than their information decoding thresholds. Both the non-robust and the robust designs are studied. For the non-robust design, the optimal solution is derived. For the robust design, an approximate optimal solution is obtained by using Gaussian randomization procedure. Simulation results show that compared with traditional non-MARS-aided beamforming design, our proposed design is superior in terms of the total required transmit power. It also shows that employing the non-linear EH model can avoid false output power at the ERs and/or save power at the transmitter.},

   abstract = {Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy, relying on linearly precoded rate-splitting at the transmitter and opportunistic transmission of the common message by the relaying user, has recently been shown to outperform typical Non-cooperative Rate-Splitting (NRS), Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (C-NOMA) and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) in a two-user Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with user relaying. In this work, the existing two-user CRS transmission strategy is generalized to the K-user case. We study the problem of jointly optimizing the precoders, message split, time slot allocation, and relaying user scheduling with the objective of maximizing the minimum rate among users subject to a transmit power constraint at the base station. As the user scheduling problem is discrete and the entire problem is non-convex, we propose a two-stage low-complexity algorithm to solve the problem. Both centralized and decentralized relaying protocols based on selecting K\{1\} ( K\{1\} < K ) strongest users are first proposed followed by a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to jointly optimize the time slot, precoders and message split. Numerical results show that by applying the proposed two-stage algorithm, the worst-case achievable rate achieved by CRS is significantly increased over that of NRS and SDMA in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel strengths). Importantly, the proposed SCA-based algorithm dramatically reduces the computational complexity without any rate loss compared with the conventional algorithm in the literature of CRS. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed K-user CRS combined with the two-stage algorithm is more powerful than the existing transmission schemes.},

Using a sigmoid NLEH model with sensitivity, we tackle the joint energy BF and time allocation problem in two steps by solving the NLEH-aware energy BF problem for given time allocation and then solving the convex time allocation problem formulated with the aforementioned energy BF solution. We propose several iterative methods to solve the non-convex energy BF problem with and without approximation of the NLEH function. In addition, we present an asymptotic energy BF problem for a large-antenna system that can be solved at low complexity. The results show that the algorithms developed with a simple NLEH approximation provide almost the same performance with the algorithms developed with the exact NLEH function. Furthermore, the sensitivity region of the NLEH should be considered more carefully than the saturation region in the max-min rate optimization problem.},

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.},

In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

As the system is highly dynamic and complex, and it is challenging to address the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based secure beamforming approach is firstly proposed to achieve the optimal beamforming policy against eavesdroppers in dynamic environments. Furthermore, post-decision state (PDS) and prioritized experience replay (PER) schemes are utilized to enhance the learning efficiency and secrecy performance. Specifically, a modified PDS scheme is presented to trace the channel dynamic and adjust the beamforming policy against channel uncertainty accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep PDS-PER learning based secure beamforming approach can significantly improve the system secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction probability in IRS-aided secure communication systems.},

Powering the massive number of embedded devices is a key challenge of designing IoT, since batteries increase the devices' form factors and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WP-BackCom) network. In this network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters, including backscatter duty cycle, reflection coefficient, and the PB density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are quantified.},

Those waveforms have been designed, assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the energy transmitter (ET) transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder within a codebook, and the energy receiver (ER) reports the index of the precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback, the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines, achieving higher harvested energy.},

To this end, we introduce duty cycle operation for the dual mode SWIPT with self-powering, which considers nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model for both single tone and multi-tone waveforms. We formulate an adaptive mode switching (MS) problem which maximizes the achievable rate under the energy causality condition. On top of this, a novel iterative inner/outer loop algorithm is implemented to solve the adaptive MS problem. Our newly designed dual mode SWIPT can be applied to low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) network with wireless EH capability for self-powering, thereby realizing battery-free IoT network. From the results presented, we provide interesting insights that can be applied to design the dual mode SWIPT system over existing SWIPT.},

As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis.

   abstract = {Backscattering communications have been recently proposed as an effective enabling technology for massive Internet of Things (IoT) development. A novel application of backscattering, called ambient backscattering (AmBC), has been gaining much attention, wherein backscattering communications exploit existing RF signals without the need for a dedicated transmitter. In such a system, data demodulation process is strongly complicated by the random nature of the illuminating signal, as well as by the presence of the direct-link interference (DLI) from the legacy system. To overcome these shortcomings, one can resort to noncoherent detection strategies, aimed at reducing or even nullifying the amount of a priori information needed to reliably perform signal demodulation. In this paper, we investigate noncoherent detection strategies for backscatter communications over ambient OFDM signals and solve the noncoherent maximumlikelihood (ML) detection problem for a general Q-ary signal constellation. Additionally, we derive a suboptimal detector, which takes the form of the classical energy-detector (ED), whose performance is evaluated in closed-form. Finally, the performance of the proposed detectors is corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types (fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.},

It is found that the use of tags that have polarization diversity can improve the read performance when they are placed in close proximity to one another compared with conventional linear tags. Two ways of achieving polarization diversity are studied in this paper, namely: 1) using a circularly polarized tag and 2) using a cross-polarized tag pair. Both methods show an improvement in close proximity read performance and it is experimentally demonstrated that by using cross-polarized tag pairs in an array, one achieves on average a 2.6-dB increase in read power margin for a 57-tag array with 1 cm separation compared with using conventional linearly polarized tags.},

This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit beamforming and IRS control, whose goal is to maximize the secrecy rate under the total transmission power and unit-modulus constraints. The problem is difficult to solve optimally due to the nonconvexity of constraint conditions and coupled variables. To deal with this problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and manifold optimization (MO) technologies. Numerical simulations show that the proposed AO-based algorithm can effectively improve the secrecy rate and outperforms traditional single IRS-Aided scheme.},

In this paper, we study an IRS- enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which an IRS is deployed to assist the communication between a nearby user and its associated base station (BS). We aim to maximize the downlink achievable rate for the user by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the passive array reflection coefficients at the IRS. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the BS's power allocation and the IRS's passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the cases without the IRS or with other heuristic IRS designs.},

   abstract = {Space-division multiple access (SDMA) utilizes linear precoding to separate users in the spatial domain and relies on fully treating any residual multi-user interference as noise. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uses linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to superpose users in the power domain and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some users to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this paper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput, heterogeneity of quality of service (QoS), and massive connectivity requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design needs to depart from those two extreme interference management strategies, namely fully treat interference as noise (as in SDMA) and fully decode interference (as in NOMA). Considering a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, we develop a novel multiple access framework, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general and more powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise and provides room for rate and QoS enhancements and complexity reduction. The three multiple access schemes are compared, and extensive numerical results show that RSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths, and qualities of channel state information at the transmitter). Moreover, RSMA provides rate and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers (number of SIC layers).},

   abstract = {Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users\{\&\}\{\#\}x2019; channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA scheme to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at the RIS. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station, the phase-shift matrix at the RIS, and user ordering. To address challenge due to the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem under a specific user ordering into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. To accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users\{\&\}\{\#\}x2019; target data rates. Simulation results validate the ability of an RIS in enlarging the channel-gain difference when the users\{\&\}\{\#\}x2019; original channel conditions are similar and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in reducing the total transmit power.},

   abstract = {By defining mutual information as a maximum over an appropriate space, channel capacities can be defined as double maxima and rate-distortion functions as double minima. This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source. © 1972, IEEE. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables radio-frequency (RF) powered backscatter devices (BDs) (e.g., sensors and tags) to modulate their information bits over ambient RF carriers in an over-the-air manner. This technology, also called 'modulation in the air,' has emerged as a promising solution to achieve green communication for future Internet of Things. This paper studies an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol period is designed as an integer multiplication of the OFDM symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit '0' maintains the same state within the BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit '1' has a state transition in the middle of each OFDM symbol period within the BD symbol period. In the receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test statistic which is a linear combination of the per-antenna test statistics and derive the corresponding optimal detector. The proposed optimal detectors require only knowing the strength of the backscatter channel, thus simplifying their implementation. Moreover, practical timing synchronization algorithms are proposed for the designed AmBC system, and we also analyze the effect of various system parameters on the transmission rate and detection performance. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design can improve the system bit-error-rate performance and the operating range significantly and achieve much higher data rate, as compared with the conventional design.},

   abstract = {Wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC) has been identified as a promising technology for low-power communication systems, which can reap the benefits of energy beamforming to improve energy transfer efficiency. However, existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy supply and information transfer in WPBC into account. This paper takes the first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable communication and user fairness, we formulate the energy beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the closed-form expression of the energy harvesting rate, as well as the lower bound of the achievable rate for maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Our numerical results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art energy beamforming schemes. Additionally, the achievable rate of our scheme approaches more than 90% of the rate limit achieved via beamforming with perfect CSI for both receivers.},

To reveal the SWIPT mechanism and evaluate the SWIPT performance, we establish an analytical end-to-end (E2E) transmission model based on a modular approach and the electromagnetic field propagation. Then, the intra-cavity power intensity distribution, transmission loss, output power, and E2E efficiency can be obtained. The numerical evaluation illustrates that the exemplary RB-SWIPT system can provide about 4.20W electric power and 12.41bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and shorter transmission distance or larger retro-reflecting surface size can lead to higher E2E efficiency. The RB-SWIPT presents a new way for high-power, long-range WPT, and high-rate communication.},

Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we present two important results. First, we improve the existing energy detector by calculating the optimal averaging power orders.

   abstract = {In this paper, we take a critical and fresh look at the downlink multi-antenna NOMA literature. Instead of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we contrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional Multi-User Linear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some confusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated misconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna settings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue lies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna setups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in multiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe multiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an inefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits of NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to MULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that multi-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other users. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion, rate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our results confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna settings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa, and demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages of NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not beneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is that other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which fully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate in multi-antenna settings.},

The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an M -ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.},

At the same time, it may be necessary to keep the interference generated on other coexisting systems under a certain tolerable level. In addition, one may want to include general individual shaping constraints on the beamforming vectors. This beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic program, and it is difficult to solve in general.

   abstract = {The capacity of noncoherent time-selective Rayleigh-fading channels is studied under various models for the variations in time. The study includes both single-input and single-output (SISO) and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A block-fading model is first considered where the channel changes correlatively over each block period of length T, and independently across blocks. The predictability of the channel is characterized through the rank Q of the correlation matrix of the vector of channel gains in each block. This model includes, as special cases, the standard block-fading model where the channel remains constant over block periods (Q = 1), and models where the fading process has finite differential entropy rate (Q = T). The capacity is initially studied for long block lengths and some straightforward but interesting asymptotes are established. For the case where Q is kept fixed as T → ∞, it is shown that the non-coherent capacity converges to the coherent capacity. For the case where both T, Q → ∞, with Q/T being held constant, a bound on the capacity loss due to channel unpredictability is established. The more interesting scenario of large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is then explored in detail. For SISO systems, useful upper and lower bounds on the large SNR asymptotic capacity are derived, and it is shown that the capacity grows logarithmically with SNR with a slope of T/T-Q, for Q \{\textless\} T. Next, in order to facilitate the analysis of MIMO systems, the rank-Q block-fading model is specialized to the case where each T-symbol block consists of Q subblocks of length L, with the channel remaining constant over each subblock and changing correlatively across subblocks. For this model, it is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is the same as that of the standard block-fading model with block length L. Finally, the SISO and MIMO channel models are generalized to allow the fading process to be correlated across blocks in a stationary and ergodic manner. It is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is not affected by the correlation across blocks. ©2004 IEEE.},

We propose a new generic energy receiver (ER) architecture consisting of \{\$\}N\{\$\} receive antennas and \{\$\}L\{\$\} rectifiers, for which one power splitter is inserted after each antenna to adaptively split the received radio frequency (RF) signals among the \{\$\}L\{\$\} rectifiers for efficient nonlinear RF-to-direct current (dc) conversion. With the proposed architecture, we maximize the total harvested dc power at the ER, by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the energy transmitter and the power splitting ratios at the ER. Numerical results show that our proposed design by exploiting the nonlinearity of EH significantly improves the harvested dc power at the ER, as compared to two conventional designs.},

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) has been introduced to address communication and power efficiency issues for short-range and low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as a promising approach that can control the propagation environment especially in indoor communication environments. In this paper, we propose a new AmBC model over ambient orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers in the frequency domain in conjunction with RIS for short-range communication scenarios. A tag transmits one bit per each OFDM subcarrier broadcasted from a WiFi access point. Then, RIS augments the signal quality at a reader by compensating the phase distortion effect of multipath channel on the incident signal. We also exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit more data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers in the frequency domain. Consequently, the proposed method improves the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and provides a higher data rate compared to existing AmBC methods. Analytical and numerical evaluations show the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of BER and data rate.},

Here, we propose "digital metamaterials" in two steps. Firstly, we present "coding metamaterials" that are composed of only two kinds of unit cells with 0 and \{$\backslash$pi\} phase responses, which we name as "0" and "1" elements. By coding "0" and "1" elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterial can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit or more. In 2-bit coding, four kinds of unit cells with phase responses 0, \{$\backslash$pi\}/2, \{$\backslash$pi\}, and 3\{$\backslash$pi\}/2 are required to mimic "00", "01", "10" and "11" elements, which have larger freedom to control EM waves. Secondly, we propose a unique metamaterial particle which has either "0" or "1" response controlled by a biased diode. Based on the particle, we present "digital metamaterials" with unit cells having either "0" or "1" state. Using the field-programmable gate array, we realize to control the digital metamaterial digitally. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has distinct abilities in manipulating EM waves, realizing the "programming metamaterials". The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed by numerical simulations and experiments through metasurfaces.},

In WPHetNets, where various kinds of nodes such as high-power base station (e.g., TV tower and macro base station) and small-power access point (e.g., WiFi access point) coexist, we aim to increase transmission range and support fair communication through internet-of-things (IoT) device cooperation. For this, we first propose long-range bistatic backscatter (BB)-aided cooperative transmission with two-device cooperation where ambient backscatter (AB) enables short-range information exchange in sequential mode between devices nearby under energy neutral operation, termed 'Cooperation mode'. To ensure fairness between devices, we formulate common-throughput maximization problem where an algorithm for time allocation is presented. Compared with 'Non-cooperation mode' (i.e., no information exchange via AB) and active RF based cooperation schemes, the proposed scheme is shown to increase both the coverage and fairness between devices for battery-less IoT networks. We then generalize the architecture of backscatter-aided cooperative transmission with multiple-device cooperation where the information exchange is performed in sequential mode and parallel (broadcasting) mode. In the sequential mode, a graph-matching based suboptimal pairing algorithm is proposed whose validity is corroborated through comparison with a heuristic search based optimal pairing, and then we compare the two modes for multiple-device cooperation.},

A special case of the problem that we study corresponds to the max-3-cut model used in a recent paper of Goemans and Williamson [J. Comput. System Sci., 68 (2004), pp. 442-470]. We first develop a closed-form formula to compute the probability of a complex-valued normally distributed bivariate random vector to be in a given angular region. This formula allows us to compute the expected value of a randomized (with a specific rounding rule) solution based on the optimal solution of the complex semidefinite programming relaxation problem. In particular, we present an \{m2(1 -cos 2$π$/m)/87$π$]-approximation algorithm, and then study the limit of that model, in which the problem remains NP-hard. We show that if the objective is to maximize a positive semidefinite Hermitian form, then the randomization-rounding procedure guarantees a worst-case performance ratio of $π$/4 ≈ 0.7854, which is better than the ratio of 2/$π$ ≈ 0.6366 for its counterpart in the real case due to Nesterov. Furthermore, if the objective matrix is real-valued positive semidefinite with nonpositive off-diagonal elements, then the performance ratio improves to 0.9349. ©2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\}},

To address these issues, we propose a novel receiver design to perform joint channel estimation, user data decoding, and BD symbol detection.

   abstract = {Information-theoretic limits to spectral efficiency in dense wavelength-division-multiplexed (DWDM) transmission systems are reviewed, considering various modulation techniques (unconstrained, constant-intensity, binary), detection techniques (coherent, direct), and propagation regimes (linear, nonlinear). Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source. These include a) pulse-amplitude modulation with direct detection, b) differential phase-shift keying with interferometric detection, c) phase-shift keying with coherent detection, and d) quadrature-amplitude modulation with coherent detection.},

These problems capture a class of well-known combinatorial optimization problems, as well as problems in control theory. For instance, they include the MAX-3-CUT problem where the Laplacian matrix is positive semidefinite (in particular, some of the edge weights can be negative). We present a generic algorithm and a unified analysis of the SDP relaxations which allow us to obtain good approximation guarantees for our models. Specifically, we give an (k sin($π$/k))2/(4$π$) -approximation algorithm for the discrete problem where the decision variables are k-ary and the objective matrix is positive semidefinite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known approximation result for this family of problems. For the continuous problem where the objective matrix is positive semidefinite, we obtain the well-known $π$ /4 result due to Ben-Tal et al.

In addition, we show for the first time that the gap between the optimal value of the original problem and that of the SDP relaxation can be arbitrarily close to $π$ /4.

   abstract = {The novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated, where the incident wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into both sides of the space surrounding the surface, thus facilitating a full-space manipulation of signal propagation. Based on the introduced basic signal model of `STAR', three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). Moreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both unicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power consumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols, subject to communication rate constraints of the users. For ES, the resulting highly-coupled non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm, which exploits the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Then, the proposed penalty-based iterative algorithm is extended to solve the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for MS. For TS, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which can be consecutively solved using state-of-the-art algorithms and convex optimization techniques. Finally, our numerical results reveal that: 1) the TS and ES operating protocols are generally preferable for unicast and multicast transmission, respectively; and 2) the required power consumption for both scenarios is significantly reduced by employing the proposed STAR-RIS instead of conventional reflecting/transmiting-only RISs.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the problem of maximizing the wireless users' sum-rate for uplink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) communications is studied. We aim to maximize the sum-rate with proportional rate constraints by adjusting the users' transmit power and the BS's decoding order. The original maximization problem with transmit power and decoding order variables can be transformed into a problem with only the rate splitting variable. Then, the optimal rate splitting of each user is determined. Given the optimal rate splitting of each user and a decoding order, the optimal transmit power of each user is calculated. Next, the optimal decoding order is determined by an exhaustive search method. To further reduce the complexity of the optimization algorithm used for sum-rate maximization in RSMA, a user pairing based algorithm is introduced. For comparisons, the optimal sum-rate maximizing solutions with proportional rate constraints are obtained for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). Simulation results show that RSMA can achieve up to 10.0%, 22.2%, and 81.2% gains in terms of sum-rate compared to NOMA, FDMA, and TDMA.},

The primary transmitter (PT) with multiple antennas is designed to broadcast common messages to the primary receiver (PR) and the BD, as well as to support passive information transmission from the BD to the PR. To do so, the full-duplex BD absorbs a fraction of the incident signal from the PT to decode the common messages and simultaneously transmits its own information to the PR by backscattering the remaining part of the incident signal. We derive the achievable rates of the BD transmission with Gaussian and quadrature amplitude modulation codewords. We also formulate a transmit power minimization problem by jointly designing the beamforming vector at the PT and the power splitting factor at the BD. This problem is first solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique together with a one-dimensional linear exhaustive search over the power splitting factor. Then, a suboptimal but low-complexity solution with closed-form expressions is proposed. The simulation results have shown that the proposed suboptimal solution achieves almost the same performance as that obtained by the exhaustive search. In addition, our proposed SR system with the full-duplex BD outperforms the half-duplex system with the time-division-multiplexing mode in general.},

Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are derived based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum output DC current, subject to transmit power constraints and passive beamforming phases unit modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users' individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity. Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC current than FS-IRS, it still achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs. Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform and passive beamforming design accounting for the energy harvester nonlinearity to boost the performance of single-user and multi-user WPT system.},

Such networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. The design of such future networks brings new challenges and opportunities for signal processing, machine learning, sensing, and computing so as to make the best use of the RF radiations, spectrum, and network infrastructure in providing cost-effective and real-time power supplies to wireless devices and enable wireless-powered applications. In this paper, we first review recent signal processing techniques to make WPT and wireless information and power transfer as efficient as possible. Topics include power amplifier and energy harvester nonlinearities, active and passive beamforming, intelligent reflecting surfaces, receive combining with multi-antenna harvester, modulation, coding, waveform, massive MIMO, channel acquisition, transmit diversity, multi-user power region characterization, coordinated multipoint, and distributed antenna systems. Then, we overview two different design methodologies: the model and optimize approach relying on analytical system models, modern convex optimization, and communication theory, and the learning approach based on data-driven end-to-end learning and physics-based learning. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, especially when accounting for various nonlinearities in wireless-powered networks, and identify interesting emerging opportunities for the approaches to complement each other. Finally, we identify new emerging wireless technologies where WPT may play a key role -- wireless-powered mobile edge computing and wireless-powered sensing -- arguing WPT, communication, computation, and sensing must be jointly designed.},

Furthermore, combining wireless power transfer with information transmission has become more appealing. In the systems that apply radio signals the wireless power transfer has become a popular trend to harvest RF-radiated energy from received information signal in IoT devices. For those systems, design frameworks mainly deal with the trade-off between information capacity and energy harvesting efficiency. Therein various signaling design frameworks have been proposed for different system preferences between power and information. In addition to this, protecting the information part from potential eavesdropping activity in a service area introduces security considerations for those systems.

It introduces a novel protocol design from opposite perspective compared to the existing studies.

   abstract = {In this paper, we consider a novel ambient backscatter multiple-access system, where a receiver (Rx) simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from an active transmitter (Tx) and a backscatter Tag. Specifically, the information-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two wireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx, and the backscatter channel from the Tx to the Tag and then to the Rx. The received signal from the backscatter channel also carries the Tag's information because of the multiplicative backscatter operation at the Tag. This multiple-access system introduces a new channel model, referred to as multiplicative multiple-access channel (M-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the M-MAC and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including, e.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger than the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme is an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter communication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the Tag, respectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further bring interesting insights for practical system design.},

A conventional approach is based on Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU-LP) where each IR directly decodes the intended stream by fully treating the interference from other IRs and ERs as noise. In this paper, we investigate the application of linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) SWIPT Broadcast Channel (BC). By splitting the messages of IRs into private and common parts and encoding the common parts into a common stream decoded by all IRs, RS manages the interference dynamically. The precoders are designed such that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of IRs is maximized under the total transmit power constraint and the sum energy constraint for ERs. Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted strategy provides a better rate-energy tradeoff in MISO SWIPT BC. Under a sum energy constraint of ERs, RS-assisted strategy achieves better WSR performance of IRs than MU-LP and NOMA in a wide range of IR and ER deployments.

Evaluating the performance and optimizing the deployment of RISs in wireless networks need physically sound frameworks that account for the actual characteristics of engineered metasurfaces. In this paper, we introduce a general macroscopic model for the realistic evaluation of RIS scattering, based on its decomposition into multiple scattering mechanisms and aimed at being embedded into ray models. Since state-of-the-art ray models can already efficiently simulate specular interactions (reflection, diffraction) and diffuse scattering, but not anomalous reradiation, we complement them with a Huygens principle approach and two possible implementations of it. The different scattering mechanisms are combined through a suitable power conservation equation. Notably, multiple reradiation modes can be modeled through the proposed approach. In addition, we validate the overall model's accuracy by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the literature, either based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, or experimental measurements.},

   abstract = {The driving force behind this work is the desire to obtain one method for estimating the ergodic capacity of lognormal (LN) channels for both Shannon capacity and constrained capacity. In recent years, researchers have determined methods for calculating the ergodic Shannon capacity for LN channels. However, in practical communication systems, the input signal is constrained to a discrete signaling set such as finite-size quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. At a high SNR, the Shannon capacity greatly overestimates the capacity of these practical systems, particularly for low-order constellations. For this reason, a method is needed to evaluate the capacity and outage probability for LN channels when the signal set is constrained to a finite alphabet. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a simple but accurate method for calculating both the ergodic Shannon capacity and the ergodic constrained capacity of practical signals for LN channels. This method also facilitates straightforward computation of outage probability and outage capacity.

   abstract = {With the proliferation of wireless applications, the electromagnetic (EM) space is becoming more and more crowded and complex. This makes it a challenging task to accommodate the growing number of radio systems with limited radio resources. In this paper, by considering the EM space as a radio ecosystem, and leveraging the analogy to the natural ecosystem in biology, a novel symbiotic communication (SC) paradigm is proposed through which the relevant radio systems, called symbiotic radios (SRs), in a radio ecosystem form a symbiotic relationship (e.g., mutualistic symbiosis) through intelligent resource/service exchange. Radio resources include, e.g., spectrum, energy, and infrastructure, while typical radio services are communicating, relaying, and computing. The symbiotic relationship can be realized via either symbiotic coevolution or symbiotic synthesis. In symbiotic coevolution, each SR is empowered with an evolutionary cycle alongside the multi-agent learning, while in symbiotic synthesis, the SRs ingeniously optimize their operating parameters and transmission protocols by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. Promisingly, the proposed SC paradigm breaks the boundary of radio systems, thus providing us a fresh perspective on radio resource management and new guidelines to design future wireless communication systems.},

For IRS-aided communications, the summary includes capacity/data rate analyses, power/spectral optimizations, channel estimation, deep learning-based design, and reliability analysis. Then we review IRSs implementations as well as the use of IRSs in secure communications, terminal-positioning, and other novel applications.

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter communications have been identified for ultra-low energy wireless communications. Indeed, a tag can send a message to a reader without emitting any wave and without battery, simply by backscattering the waves generated by a source. In the simplest implementation of such a system, the tag sends a binary message by oscillating between two states and the reader detects the bits by comparing the two distinct received powers. In this paper, for the first time, we propose to study an ambient backscatter communication system, in the presence of a diffusing surface, a simple flat panel that diffuses in all directions. We establish the analytical closed form expression of the power contrast in the presence of the surface. We show that the diffusing surface improves the power contrast. Moreover our approach allows us to express the contrast to noise ratio, and therefore to establish the BER performance. Furthermore, we derive the optimum source transmit power for a given target power contrast. This makes it possible to quantify the amount of energy that can be saved at the source side, thanks to the diffusing surface.},

This game-changing technology is especially important for stepping into the Internet of Everything (IoE) era, where high performance is demanded with very limited available resources. In this paper, we study a backscatter-assisted wireless powered communication network (BS-WPCN), in which a number of energy-constrained users, powered by a power station (PS), transmit information to an access point (AP) via backscatter and active wireless information transfer, with their communication being aided by an IRS. Using a practical energy harvesting (EH) model which is able to capture the characteristics of realistic energy harvesters, we investigate the maximization of total network throughput. Specifically, IRS reflection coefficients, PS transmit and AP receive beamforming vectors, power and time allocation are designed through a two-stage algorithm, assuming minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver at the AP. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed via extensive numerical simulations. We also show that our proposed scheme is readily applicable to practical IRS-aided networks with discrete phase shift values.},

Is this fact true for a radio system, as well? The question has existed for decades. In this article, the equivalent circuits of antenna systems are reexamined. It is demonstrated that classical equivalent circuit models based on the Thvenin and Norton theorems are not suitable for a receiving antenna system since the antenna cannot be simply approximated by a voltage or current source. A constant power source is required but not readily available. Thus, two new general power source models are introduced and examined. It is found that they may be suitable for a transmitting antenna system but not accurate enough for a receiving antenna when the antenna loss is taken into account. A novel special constant power source model is therefore proposed and shown to accurately simulate the behavior of a receiving antenna. When the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance, maximum power is obtained, and the power transfer efficiency is simultaneously maximized (up to 100\{\%\} if the antenna system is lossless).},

The choice of the load can be tricky, showing an advantage of a certain type of signals over another. For low RF power (-17dBm), the multitone signals do not improve the peak RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the continuous wave (CW) single-tone signal, if the optimal load is selected for each case, however, the multitone signals maintain that peak PCE of ∼ 47\{\%\} over higher output voltage (i.e: larger loads), and consequently enable more efficient dc-to-dc voltage boosting or even eliminate the need for the voltage booster in the RF power receiver. Thus, the low-power multitone waveforms can be considered as a voltage sensitivity booster rather than a PCE efficiency booster. This boosted rectified voltage is the key advantage of the multitone signals that leads to the enhancement in the overall efficiency of the low-RF power receiver.},

   abstract = {We study RF-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) via energy beamforming, from a multi-antenna energy transmitter (ET) to multiple energy receivers (ERs) in a backscatter communication system such as RFID. The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10\{\%\}, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

However, most previous ambient RF harvesters have been narrowband, making mobile sensing scenarios infeasible: an RF harvester tuned to work in one city will not generally work in another, as the spectral environments tend to differ. This paper presents a novel approach to multiband harvesting. A single wideband antenna is followed by several narrowband rectifier chains. Each rectifier chain consists of a bandpass filter, a tuned impedance matching network, and a rectifier. The outputs of the rectifiers are combined via a novel diode summation network that enables good performance even when only a subset of the narrowband harvesters is excited. These techniques make ambient RF harvesting feasible for mobile applications. The techniques can potentially enable applications such as ambient RF-powered data logging sensors that upload data to RFID readers when in range. ©2014 IEEE.},

However, its use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is limited, since commercial scatter radio (e.g. RFID) offers short ranges of a few tens of meters. This work redesigns scatter radio systems and maximizes range through non-classic bistatic architectures: the carrier emitter is detached from the reader. It is shown that conventional radio receivers may show a potential 3dB performance loss, since they do not exploit the correct signal model for scatter radio links. Receivers for on-off-keying (OOK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) that overcome the frequency offset between the carrier emitter and the reader are presented. Additionally, non-coherent designs are also offered. This work emphasizes that sensor tag design should accompany receiver design. Impact of important parameters such as the antenna structural mode are presented through bit error rate (BER) results. Experimental measurements corroborate the long-range ability of bistatic radio; ranges of up to 130 meters with 20 milliwatts of carrier power are experimentally demonstrated, with commodity software radio and no directional antennas. Therefore, bistatic scatter radio may be viewed as a key enabling technology for large-scale, low-cost and low-power WSNs. ©2014 IEEE.},

The new matrix rank-one decomposition theorems appear to have wide applications in theory as well as in practice. On the theoretical side, for example, we show how to further extend some of the classical results including a lemma due to Yuan (Math Program 47:53-63, 1990), the classical results on the convexity of the joint numerical ranges (Pang and Zhang in Unpublished Manuscript, 2004; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979), and the so-called Finsler's lemma (Bohnenblust in Unpublished Manuscript; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979).

The new matrix decomposition theorems are proven by construction in this paper, and we demonstrate that the constructive procedures can be implemented efficiently, stably, and accurately.

QCQP problems are hard to solve, in general, and they are typically approached by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation followed by a postprocessing procedure. Existing postprocessing schemes include Gaussian randomization to generate an approximate solution, rank reduction procedure (the so-called purification), and some specific rank-one matrix decomposition techniques to yield a globally optimal solution. In this paper, we propose several randomized postprocessing methods to output not an approximate solution but a globally optimal solution for some solvable instances of the double-sided QCQP (i.e., instances with a small number of constraints). We illustrate their applicability in robust receive beamforming, radar optimal code design, and broadcast beamforming for multiuser communications. As a byproduct, we derive an alternative (shorter) proof for the Sturm-Zhang rank-one matrix decomposition theorem. ©2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper investigates a novel research direction that leverages vision to help overcome the critical wireless communication challenges. In particular, this paper considers millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, which are principal components of 5G and beyond. These systems face two important challenges: (i) the large training overhead associated with selecting the optimal beam and (ii) the reliability challenge due to the high sensitivity to link blockages. Interestingly, most of the devices that employ mmWave arrays will likely also use cameras, such as 5G phones, self-driving vehicles, and virtual/augmented reality headsets. Therefore, we investigate the potential gains of employing cameras at the mmWave base stations and leveraging their visual data to help overcome the beam selection and blockage prediction challenges. To do that, this paper exploits computer vision and deep learning tools to predict mmWave beams and blockages directly from the camera RGB images and the sub-6GHz channels. The experimental results reveal interesting insights into the effectiveness of such solutions. For example, the deep learning model is capable of achieving over 90$\backslash$\{\%\} beam prediction accuracy, which only requires snapping a shot of the scene and zero overhead.},

   abstract = {Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag. This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an -ary modulator can achieve higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorless -ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW. ©2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {As backscatter-based IoT applications get proliferated, how to exploit backscattered signals for efficient sensing becomes a significant issue. Backscatter-based sensing requires accurate estimation of a backscatter channel (phase and amplitude), which is distorted when multiple signals collide with each other. As a result, the state of the arts is limited to either parallel decoding of collided signal or channel estimation with clean signal. Motivated by the need of high sensing capacity, we in this article present Fireworks, the first approach for channel estimation of parallel backscattered signals. The insight of Fireworks is that although the channel is distorted due to collision, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve the channel properties of the respective tags. By modeling the relationship between the channels and the signal's moving trajectory in the IQ domain, one can make accurate estimation of the channels directly from the collision. We address practical problems of Fireworks, such as the high computing complexity and the compatibility with the commercial MAC protocol, and implement Fireworks. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate the channels of up to five tags in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2sim 4times improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

   abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an ?all-surpassing importance to man? [1]. A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays [2], contact-lens-based augmented reality [3], and smart dust [4], among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla?s work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed. ©2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {This paper studies a novel user cooperation method in a wireless powered cooperative communication network (WPCN) in which a pair of distributed terminal users first harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node and then use the harvested energy to transmit information to a destination node (DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent information with each other so as to form a virtual antenna array and transmit jointly to the DN. By allowing the users to share their harvested energy to transmit each other's information, the proposed method can effectively mitigate the inherent user unfairness problem in WPCN, where one user may suffer from very low data rate due to poor energy harvesting performance and high data transmission consumptions. Depending on the availability of channel state information at the transmitters, we consider the two users cooperating using either coherent or non-coherent data transmissions. In both cases, we derive the maximum common throughput achieved by the cooperation schemes through optimizing the time allocation on wireless energy transfer, user message exchange, and joint information transmissions in a fixed-length time slot. We also perform numerical analysis to study the impact of channel conditions on the system performance. By comparing with some existing benchmark schemes, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user cooperation in a WPCN under different application scenarios.},

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO. ©2014 IEEE.},

Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (ABD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RFsource signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.},

   abstract = {Proper operation of active circuits in a wirelessly powered system requires both sufficient power flow and voltage. Passive (battery-less) wireless systems, operating in the high-frequency band, pose a challenge: generating sufficient amount of supply voltage from very low-input-power flow. The answer to this problem involves implementation of a new class of power-sipping, voltage multiplying power management blocks, which have a wide variety of applications from implantable microelectronic devices (IMD) to internet of things (IoT) and radio-frequency identification (RFID). This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey on the rectification and voltage multiplication of low-input power signals in the frequency range of 100 MH z-1 GH z in remotelypowered systems which require up to several hundred ?A current and operate with less than 3 V supply voltage. The survey covers topologies of voltage multipliers, novel devices, and efficiency/voltage boosting techniques. Since existing voltage multipliers are designed with various process technologies, a comparison among available devices in various topologies is difficult. For a fair comparison between specifications of several state-of-the-art topologies, we have migrated and simulated some of them in one exemplar process technology under the same set of constraints. We observe that the voltage multiplier with cross-coupled configuration yields the best power conversion efficiency at an optimized input voltage; however, it drops immediately after this voltage is reached. We also found that the voltage multiplier with Schottky diodes, used in the Dickson topology, exhibits the lowest sensitivity. When input voltage increases to a level of more than 1 V, the Dickson voltage multiplier with ultra-low-power diodes maintains the highest efficiency, reaching around 80\{\%\} in the wide input voltage range. To gain a perspective of practical implementation, we also explore various design issues.},

   abstract = {The prospect of base station cooperation leading to joint combining at widely separated antennas has led to increased interest in macrodiversity systems, where both sources and receive antennas are geographically distributed. In this scenario, analytical investigation of channel capacity is extremely challenging for finite-size systems since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper, we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity multiple-input multiple-output system with arbitrary numbers of sources and receive antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute the exact ergodic capacity for a system with at most two transmit antennas and a compact approximation for the general system, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we compare our results with previous asymptotic results and bounds. Results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations and the impact on capacity of various channel power profiles is investigated. ©1963-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). ©1972-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {We study the effect of channel fading in wireless power transfer (WPT) and show that fading enhances the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of nonlinear RF energy harvesters. We then develop a new form of signal design for WPT, denoted as transmit diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity. In contrast with (energy) beamforming, transmit diversity does not rely on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the average power at the energy harvester input, even though it still enhances the overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit diversity is also combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50\{\%\} in harvested DC power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of CSIT.},

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

   abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called «rate-energy (R-E)» region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS. ©1972-2012 IEEE.},

Different from the current LTE radio access scheme (until Release 11), NOMA superposes multiple users in the power domain although its basic signal waveform could be based on the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-spread OFDM the same as LTE baseline. In our concept, NOMA adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver as the baseline receiver scheme for robust multiple access, considering the expected evolution of device processing capabilities in the future. Based on system-level evaluations, we show that the downlink NOMA with SIC improves both the capacity and cell-edge user throughput performance irrespective of the availability of the frequency-selective channel quality indicator (CQI) on the base station side. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions of NOMA by jointly applying multi-antenna/site technologies with a proposed NOMA/MIMO scheme using SIC and an interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver to achieve further capacity gains, e.g., a three-fold gain in the spectrum efficiency representing a challenging target for FRA. ©2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band provides huge bandwidth but the molecular absorptions in these frequencies cause high path losses in long-distance communications. Recently, multi-band ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems based on graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas have been proposed to overcome the distance problem. In the UM MIMO systems, the mutual coupling effect is a challenging problem because of the ultra-dense integration of the multi-band nano-antenna arrays. In this paper, a graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed to reduce the coupling effects in dense plasmonic nano-antenna arrays for multi-band UM MIMO systems. The performance of the proposed structure is evaluated by full-wave simulation for different cases. The results show that the FSS structure has a wide stopband (-15 dB bandwidth, approximately 43\{\%\}-50\{\%\}) from 1.1 to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between nano-antennas, a high isolation coefficient of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall and an envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.01 are achieved. The field distributions and the radiation patterns are also presented to confirm that the proposed FSS structure improves the performance of the array with negligible influence on the antenna itself. Moreover, the receiving mode simulation of the array is performed with the FSS structure. It is also asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of a very large number of closely integrated elements. Finally, the technological issues are discussed for practical implementations.},

The concept of normalized power loss per bit is introduced for such RFID communication systems to capture the consequent trade-offs, that form the crux of the results. We explore the use of higher dimensional (4-QAM) modulation schemes in future RFID systems (beyond current binary modulation in Class-1 Gen 2) as a means to improve uplink bit rate. However, this results in significantly increased normalized power loss vis-a-vis 2-PSK, suggesting a role for FEC coding. New coded modulation schemes - based on unequal error protection - are proposed that provides additional degrees of freedom (via choice of code parameters) to trade-off spectral efficiency with normalized power loss.

Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and (passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI) available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without the IRS.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, wireless power is delivered through single-carrier, continuous-wave (CW) signals. Most research efforts to enhance the efficiency of wireless power transfer systems have been confined to the circuit-level design. However, in recent years, attention has been paid to the waveform design for wireless power transmission. It has been found that signals featuring a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can provide efficiency improvement when compared with CW signals. A number of approaches have been proposed, such as multisines/multicarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signals, chaotic signals, harmonicsignals, ultrawideband (UWB) signals, intermittent CW (ICW) signals, or white-noise signals. This article reviews these techniques with a focus on multisines/multicarrier signals, harmonic signals, and chaotic signals. A theoretical explanation for efficiency improvement is provided and accompanied by experimental results. Circuit design considerations are presented for the receiver side, and efficient transmission architectures are also described with an emphasis on spatial power combining.},

   abstract = {The low efficiency of far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) limits the fundamental rate-energy (R-E) performance trade-off of the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. To address this challenge, we propose in this letter a new SWIPT system aided by the emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT systems. We consider an IRS being deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of their channel realizations. Moreover, simulation results show significant performance gains achieved by our proposed designs over benchmark schemes.},

To this end, the fractional programming (FP)-based quadratic transform is employed to reformulate the non-convex SINR constraint of the original problem into a tractable quadratic form, which contains an estimate of the CSI error vector as a parameter. Taking advantage of the fact that the zero duality gap holds for the non-convex quadratic problems, a closed-form expression for an estimate of the CSI error vector is derived, completing the formulation. Finally, a novel iterative algorithm based on both the herein derived CSI error vector and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is contributed, which is shown to capable of efficiently solving the constrained min-power problem. Simulation results are given which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is found to sacrifice only small quantities of transmit power in return for a substantial increase in robustness against CSI imperfection.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.},

Prior work mostly assumed a fixed RIS configuration irrespective of the transmitted information. In contrast, this work derives information-theoretic limits, and demonstrates that the capacity is achieved by a scheme that jointly encodes information in the transmitted signal as well as in the RIS configuration. In addition, a novel signaling strategy based on layered encoding is proposed that enables practical successive cancellation-type decoding at the receiver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the standard max-SNR scheme that fixes the configuration of the RIS as to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver is strictly suboptimal, and is outperformed by the proposed strategies at all practical SNR levels.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) is subject to nonlinearity at the energy harvester that leads to significant changes to transmit signal designs compared to conventional wireless communications. In this paper, the capacity of a discrete time, memoryless and complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel in the presence of a nonlinear energy harvester at the receiver is studied. Considering the two common nonlinear energy harvester models introduced in the literature, two sets of constraints are considered. First the capacity is studied under average power (AP), peak amplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity is studied under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled as satisfying a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the received signal being outside of a given interval. Similarly, it is shown that the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite number of mass points.},

   abstract = {We study the capacity of the discrete-time Gaussian channel when its output is quantized with a 1-bit quantizer. We focus on the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, where communication at very low spectral efficiencies takes place. In this regime, a symmetric threshold quantizer is known to reduce channel capacity by a factor of 2/π , i.e., to cause an asymptotic power loss of approximately 2 dB. Here, it is shown that this power loss can be avoided by using asymmetric threshold quantizers and asymmetric signaling constellations. To avoid this power loss, flash-signaling input distributions are essential. Consequently, 1-bit output quantization of the Gaussian channel reduces spectral efficiency. Threshold quantizers are not only asymptotically optimal: at every fixed SNR, a threshold quantizer maximizes capacity among all 1-bit output quantizers. The picture changes on the Rayleigh-fading channel. In the noncoherent case, a 1-bit output quantizer causes an unavoidable low-SNR asymptotic power loss. In the coherent case, however, this power loss is avoidable provided that we allow the quantizer to depend on the fading level. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, we show that an optimal quantizer (possibly with multiple thresholds) is the one with the thresholding vector whose elements are all the solutions of $r(y)=r^\{*\}$ for some constant $r^\{*\}>0$. In addition, we also characterize necessary conditions using fixed point theorem for the optimality and uniqueness of a quantizer.

It was found in [1] that this problem can be solved optimally using a dynamic programming approach, which takes only O(M3) worst-case complexity. We first present a new formulation of the problem, as a K-hop single source shortest path problem (K-hop SSSPP) in a graph G(V, E) with M+1 vertices and (M2 (M+1)-K2 (K-1)) edges. This new formulation can in the future serve as a basis to several algorithms on channel quantization.

This implies that we can only expect a constant factor improvement in complexity with any other optimal quantizers, until more specific properties of the graph such as edges and their cost-structure with concave mutual information function are exploited in designing the algorithms (e.g. [2], [3]). We finally present a new optimal quantizer algorithm based on the classic Bellman-Ford algorithm on G, achieving a constant factor improvement in complexity. We claim that our algorithm will be about 50% faster than [1].},

   abstract = {Cognitive radio has been recognized as one of the most promising technologies dealing with the scarcity of the radio spectrum. In cognitive radio system, with spectrum sensing, secondary users are allowed to utilize the frequency bands of primary users when the bands are idle. Hence, how to accurately detect the idle frequency bands has attracted many researchers' eyes. Energy detection is the common method for idle band detection. However, the improper energy detection threshold setting can dramatically affect the performance of the cognitive radio system. There are two types of errors in spectrum sensing: false alarm and miss-detection. The lower probability of false alarm means more underutilized spectrum can be reused by secondary users and the lower probability of miss-detection, the better primary users are protected. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate search method for optimal local energy detection threshold, which can minimize the total errors in spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that our estimated optimal energy threshold is consistent with the actual one. © 2010 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Otsu's method of image segmentation selects an optimum threshold by maximizing the between-class variance in a gray image. However, this method becomes very time-consuming when extended to a multi-level threshold problem due to the fact that a large number of iterations are required for computing the cumulative probability and the mean of a class. To greatly improve the efficiency of Otsu's method, a new fast algorithm called the TSMO method (Two-Stage Multithreshold Otsu method) is presented. The TSMO method outperforms Otsu's method by greatly reducing the iterations required for computing the between-class variance in an image. The experimental results show that the computational time increases exponentially for the conventional Otsu method with an average ratio of about 76. For TSMO-32, the maximum computational time is only 0.463 s when the class number M increases from two to six with relative errors of less than 1% when compared to Otsu's method. The ratio of computational time of Otsu's method to TSMO-32 is rather high, up to 109,708, when six classes (M = 6) in an image are used. This result indicates that the proposed method is far more efficient with an accuracy equivalent to Otsu's method. It also has the advantage of having a small variance in runtimes for different test images. Crown Copyright © 2008.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we study a general multi-cluster wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with user cooperation under harvest-then-transmit (HTT) protocol where the hybrid access point (HAP) as well as each user is equipped with multiple antennas. In the downlink phase of HTT, the HAP employs beamforming to transfer energy to the users. In the uplink phase, users in each cluster transmit their signals to the HAP and to their cluster heads (CHs). Afterward, the CHs first relay the signals of their cluster users and then transmit their own information signals to the HAP. The aim is to design the energy beamforming (EB) matrix, transmit covariance matrices of the users and time allocations among energy transfer and cooperation phases in order to optimize the max-min and sum throughputs of the network. The corresponding maximization problems are non-convex and NP-hard in general. We devise iterative algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and then the minorization-maximization (MM) technique is used to deal with the non-convex sub-problems with respect to (w.r.t.) the EB and covariance matrices in each iteration. We recast the resulting sub-problems as a convex second order cone programming (SOCP) and quadratic constraint quadratic programming (QCQP) for the max-min and sum throughput maximization problems, respectively. We also consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the HAP and CHs and non-linearity in energy harvesting (EH) circuits. Numerical examples show that the proposed cooperative method can effectively improve the achievable throughput in the multi-cluster wireless powered communication under various setups.},

   abstract = {Otsu reference proposed a criterion for maximizing the between-class variance of pixel intensity to perform picture thresholding. However, Otsu's method for image segmentation is very time-consuming because of the inefficient formulation of the between-class variance. In this paper, a faster version of Otsu's method is proposed for improving the efficiency of computation for the optimal thresholds of an image. First, a criterion for maximizing a modified between-class variance that is equivalent to the criterion of maximizing the usual between-class variance is proposed for image segmentation. Next, in accordance with the new criterion, a recursive algorithm is designed to efficiently find the optimal threshold. This procedure yields the same set of thresholds as the original method. In addition, the modified between-class variance can be pre-computed and stored in a look-up table. Our analysis of the new criterion clearly shows that it takes less computation to compute both the cumulative probability (zeroth order moment) and the mean (first order moment) of a class, and that determining the modified between-class variance by accessing a look-up table is quicker than that by performing mathematical arithmetic operations. For example, the experimental results of a five-level threshold selection show that our proposed method can reduce down the processing time from more than one hour by the conventional Otsu's method to less than 107 seconds.},

The DP method has complexity O(q (N-M)2 ,M) , where N and M are the alphabet sizes of the DMC output and quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality, two techniques are applied to reduce the DP method's complexity. One technique makes use of the Shor-Moran-Aggarwal-Wilber-Klawe (SMAWK) algorithm and achieves complexity O(q (N-M) M). The other technique is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity O(q (N2 - M2)). We further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal among all quantizers and the two techniques are applicable. This generalizes the results in the literature for binary-input DMC. Next, we show that the cost function of α -mutual information ( α -MI)-maximizing quantizer belongs to the category of C. We further prove that under a weaker condition than the sufficient condition we derived, the aforementioned two techniques are applicable to the design of α -MI-maximizing quantizer.

In the considered system, the original message at the transmitter is first divided into two parts: (i) active transmit message and (ii) backscatter message. Then, the active transmit message is transmitted by using the conventional wireless transmission method while the backscatter message is transmitted by backscattering the active transmit signals via an ambient backscatter tag. As the backscatter tag does not generate any active signals, it is intractable for the adversary to detect the backscatter message. Therefore, secret information, e.g., secret key for decryption, can be carried by the backscattered message, making the adversary unable to decode the original message. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution can help to significantly enhance security protection for communication systems.},

   abstract = {Over the last two decades, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has become a very popular and widespread technique, with the number of publications and presentations making use of STEM techniques increasing by about an order of magnitude. Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom. We hope that the following chapters demonstrate the spectacular results that can be achieved when performing the relatively simple experiment of focusing a beam of electrons down to an atomic scale and measuring the scattering that results.

   abstract = {The large-scale reflector array of programmable metasurfaces is capable of increasing the power efficiency of backscatter communications via passive beamforming and thus has the potential to revolutionize the low-data-rate nature of backscatter communications. In this paper, we propose to design the power-efficient higher-order constellation and reflection pattern under the amplitude constraint brought by backscatter communications. For constellation design, we adopt the amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK) constellation and optimize the parameters of APSK such as ring number, ring radius, and inter-ring phase difference. Specifically, we derive closed-form solutions to the optimal ring radius and inter-ring phase difference for an arbitrary modulation order. For reflection pattern design, we propose to optimize the passive beamforming vector by solving a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes reflection power and guarantees beam homogenization within the interested angle range. To solve the problem, we propose a constant-modulus power iteration method, which is proven to be monotonically increasing, to maximize the objective function in each iteration. Numerical results show that the proposed APSK constellation design and reflection pattern design outperform the existing modulation and beam pattern design in programmable metasurface-enabled backscatter communications.},

   abstract = {We propose an iterative method for approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite-dimensional output under additional constraints on the input distribution. Based on duality of convex programming, we derive explicit upper and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an additive ε-close estimate to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires O((N V M)M3 log(N)1/2 ε-1) steps, where N denotes the input alphabet size and M denotes the output dimension. We then generalize the method to the task of approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded continuous input alphabet and a finite-dimensional output. This, using the idea of a universal encoder, allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity for channels with a finite-dimensional quantum mechanical input and output. In particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can be reduced to a multi-dimensional integration problem. For certain families of quantum channels, we prove that the complexity to derive an additive ε-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate the performance of the approximation scheme in practice.},

Upper bounds on channel capacity and lower bounds on rate distortion can be efficiently generated from their duals. For channel capacity, the geometric programming dual characterization is shown to be equivalent to the minmax Kullback-Leibler (KL) characterization in [10], [14]. For rate distortion, the geometric programming dual is extended to rate distortion with two-sided state information. A "duality by mapping" is then given between the Lagrange dual problems of channel capacity with input cost and rate distortion, which resolves several apparent asymmetries between their primal problems in the familiar form of mutual information optimization problems. Both the primal and dual problems can be interpreted in a common framework of free energy optimization from statistical physics.},

Then, we introduce the optimization problem, standard optimization problems (including linear programming, quadratic programming, and semidefinite programming), and convex problems. We also introduce some techniques such as eliminating inequality, equality, and set constraints, adding slack variables, and epigraph form. We introduce Lagrangian function, dual variables, KKT conditions (including primal feasibility, dual feasibility, weak and strong duality, complementary slackness, and stationarity condition), and solving optimization by method of Lagrange multipliers. Then, we cover first-order optimization including gradient descent, line-search, convergence of gradient methods, momentum, steepest descent, and backpropagation. Other first-order methods are explained, such as accelerated gradient method, stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, stochastic average gradient, stochastic variance reduced gradient, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam optimizer, proximal methods (including proximal mapping, proximal point algorithm, and proximal gradient method), and constrained gradient methods (including projected gradient method, projection onto convex sets, and Frank-Wolfe method). We also cover non-smooth and $\ell_1$ optimization methods including lasso regularization, convex conjugate, Huber function, soft-thresholding, coordinate descent, and subgradient methods.

Emerging technologies such as ambient backscatter help fill this gap by enabling uplink communication for IoT devices.

In this paper we present Glaze, a system that overlays data on existing wireless signals to create a new channel of downlink communication for IoT backscatter devices. In particular, Glaze uses a new technique that introduces small perturbations to existing signals to convey data. We evaluate the performance of Glaze and show how it can be used across wireless standards such as FM, TV, or Wi-Fi to communicate with devices with minimal impact on existing data transmissions.},

Even though many gradient descent based algorithms have been studied, successive convex approximation based algorithms have been recently empirically shown to converge faster. However, such successive convex approximation based algorithms can get stuck in a first-order stationary point. To avoid that, we propose an algorithm that perturbs the optimization variable slightly at the appropriate iteration. In addition to achieving the same convergence rate results as the non-perturbed version, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to a second order stationary point. Thus, the proposed algorithm escapes the saddle point efficiently and does not get stuck at the first order saddle points.},

One option is reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which can collect wireless signals from a transmitter and passively beamform them toward the receiver. The technology has exciting prospects and is quickly gaining traction in the communication community, but in the current hype we have witnessed how several myths and overstatements are spreading in the literature. In this article, we take a neutral look at the RIS technology. We first review the fundamentals and then explain specific features that can be easily misinterpreted. In particular, we debunk three myths: 1) current network technology can only control the transmitter and receiver, not the environment in between; 2) a better asymptotic array gain is achieved than with conventional beamforming; 3) the path loss is the same as with anomalous mirrors. To inspire further research, we conclude by identifying two critical questions that must be answered for RIS to become a successful technology: 1) What is a convincing use case for RIS?; 2) How can we estimate channels and control an RIS in real time.},

Considering harvester nonlinearity, we characterize the achievable Rate-Energy (R-E) region through a joint optimization of waveform, active and passive beamforming based on the Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). This problem is solved by the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, where we obtain the active precoder in closed form, the passive beamforming by the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach, and the waveform amplitude by the Geometric Programming (GP) technique. To facilitate practical implementation, we also propose a low-complexity design based on closed-form adaptive waveform schemes. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithms bring considerable R-E gains with robustness to CSIT inaccuracy and finite IRS states, and emphasize the importance of modeling harvester nonlinearity in the IRS-aided SWIPT design.},

Once the energy source and harvester are chosen according to the environment of work, the conditioning circuit for energy management has to be appropriately designed with respect to the nature of the transductor. As a proof of concept, a photovoltaic panel is used in this work to collect the energy from the environment that is managed by a DC-DC converter and stored in a capacitor acting as battery. Such energy is used to support the power system of the tag, giving autonomy to the device and allowing data logging. In particular, the developed tag monitors the ambient temperature and the power voltage. It would be possible to add external sensors without changing the architecture. An increase in the read range of more than 200% is demonstrated. This feature is especially interesting in environments where the access could be difficult.},

   abstract = {This article focuses on the issue of cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in a mobile energy-harvesting cognitive radio network (EH-CRN), where secondary transmitters (STs) are powered by the radio-frequency (RF) signal emitted from primary transmissions. Only the STs with sufficient energy participate in CSS, and send their local sensing decisions to a fusion center (FC), which makes a final decision on the state of the spectrum by a general k-out-of-M(k) fusion rule. The target of this article is to develop an optimal CSS strategy in terms of final decision threshold $k$ that maximizes the expected achievable throughput of the EH-CRN, subject to a collision constraint and an energy causality constraint. We first show that the EH-CRN can be divided into an energy-deficit state and a spectrum-deficit state depending on the final decision threshold. The final decision threshold has a negative correlation with the number of STs participating in CSS in the energy-deficit state, and has no impact on that in the spectrum-deficit state. We then derive the collision probability and the expected achievable throughput of the EH-CRN, both of which are indicated to be determined by the active probability of a ST, the state of the spectrum, and the spectrum access opportunity. By tackling the tradeoff between the active probability and spectrum access opportunity introduced by the final decision threshold, we derive the optimal final decision threshold that maximizes the expected achievable throughput of the EH-CRN while protecting primary transmissions to a predefined extent. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the performance versus the final decision threshold. One of the main findings indicates that the optimal range of final decision threshold in the energy-deficit state could be acquired by the number of reporting received at the FC.},

   abstract = {Wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC) has been identified as a promising technology for low-power communication systems, which can reap the benefits of energy beamforming to improve energy transfer efficiency. However, existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy supply and information transfer in WPBC into account. This paper takes the first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable communication and user fairness, we formulate the energy beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the closed-form expression of the energy harvesting rate, as well as the lower bound of the achievable rate for maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Our numerical results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art energy beamforming schemes. Additionally, the achievable rate of our scheme approaches more than 90% of the rate limit achieved via beamforming with perfect CSI for both receivers.},

In this paper, we aim to characterize the energy-efficiency (EE) region of multiple-input single-output (MISO) SR systems, which is defined as all the achievable EE pairs by the active PT and passive BD. To this end, we first derive the maximum individual EE of the PT and BD, respectively, and show that there exists a non-trivial trade-off between these two EEs. To characterize such a trade-off, an optimization problem is formulated to find the Pareto boundary of the EE region by optimizing the transmit beamforming and power allocation. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to be directly solved. An efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to find a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results are provided to show that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively characterize the EE region of SR communication systems.},

In this paper, the industrial environment is categorized into different topographies. Industrial topographies are defined separately for large-scale and temporal fading, and their definition is based upon the specific physical characteristics of the local surroundings affecting both types of fading. Large-scale fading is well expressed by a one-slope path-loss model and excellent agreement with a lognormal distribution is obtained. Temporal fading is found to be Ricean and Ricean K-factors have been determined. Ricean K-factors are found to follow a lognormal distribution. © 2008 IEEE.},

However, the studies of metamaterials or metasurfaces are mainly limited to their physical features; currently, there is a lack of viewpoints on metamaterials and metasurfaces from the information perspective. Here we propose to measure the information of a coding metasurface using Shannon entropy. We establish an analytical connection between the coding pattern of an arbitrary coding metasurface and its far-field pattern. We introduce geometrical entropy to describe the information of the coding pattern (or coding sequence) and physical entropy to describe the information of the far-field pattern of the metasurface. The coding metasurface is demonstrated to enhance the information in transmitting messages, and the amount of enhanced information can be manipulated by designing the coding pattern with different information entropies. The proposed concepts and entropy control method will be helpful in new information systems (for example, communication, radar and imaging) that are based on the coding metasurfaces.},

   abstract = {Backscatter communication (BackCom), one of the core technologies to realize zero-power communication, is expected to be a pivotal paradigm for the next generation of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the "strong" direct link (DL) interference (DLI) is traditionally assumed to be harmful, and generally drowns out the "weak" backscattered signals accordingly, thus deteriorating the performance of BackCom. In contrast to the previous efforts to eliminate the DLI, in this paper, we exploit the constructive interference (CI), in which the DLI contributes to the backscattered signal. To be specific, our objective is to maximize the received signal power by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming vectors and tag selection factors, which is, however, non-convex and difficult to solve due to constraints on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In order to solve this problem, we first decompose the original problem, and then propose two algorithms to solve the sub-problem with beamforming design via a change of variables and semi-definite programming (SDP) and a greedy algorithm to solve the sub-problem with tag selection. In order to gain insight into the CI, we consider a special case with the single-antenna reader to reveal the channel angle between the backscattering link (BL) and the DL, in which the DLI will become constructive. Simulation results show that significant performance gain can always be achieved in the proposed algorithms compared with the traditional algorithms without the DL in terms of the strength of the received signal. The derived constructive channel angle for the BackCom system with the single-antenna reader is also confirmed by simulation results.},

The phase of the line-of-sight (LoS) path is modeled as a uniformly distributed random variable to take the phase-shifts due to mobility and phase noise into account. Considering the availability of prior information at the access points (APs), the phase-aware minimum mean square error (MMSE), non-aware linear MMSE (LMMSE), and least-square (LS) estimators are derived. The MMSE estimator requires perfectly estimated phase knowledge whereas the LMMSE and LS are derived without it. In the UL, a two-layer decoding method is investigated in order to mitigate both coherent and non-coherent interference. Closed-form UL SE expressions with phase-aware MMSE, LMMSE, and LS estimators are derived for maximum-ratio (MR) combining in the first layer and optimal large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) in the second layer. In the DL, two different transmission modes are studied: coherent and non-coherent. Closed-form DL SE expressions for both transmission modes with MR precoding are derived for the three estimators. Numerical results show that the LSFD improves the UL SE performance and coherent transmission mode performs much better than non-coherent transmission in the DL. Besides, the performance loss due to the lack of phase information depends on the pilot length and it is small when the pilot contamination is low.},

These applications usually require a large coverage area and minimal operation and maintenance cost. To this end, the recently emerging backscatter communication (BC) is gaining interest in both industry and academia as a new communication paradigm that provides high energy efficient communications that may even work in a battery-less mode and, thus, it is well suited for smart city applications. However, the coverage of BC in urban area deployments is not available, and the feasibility of its utilization for smart city applications is not known. In this article, we present a comprehensive coverage study of a practical cellular carrier-based BC system for indoor and outdoor scenarios in a downtown area of a Helsinki city. In particular, we evaluate the coverage outage performance of different low-power and wide area technologies, i.e., long range (LoRa) backscatter, arrow band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT), and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) based BC at different frequencies of operation. To do so, we carry out a comprehensive campaign of simulations while using a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) ray tracing (RT) tool, ITU outdoor model, and 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) indoor hotspot model. This study also covers the energy harvesting aspects of backscatter device, and it highlights the importance of future backscatter devices with high energy harvesting efficiency. The simulation results and discussion provided in this article will be helpful in understanding the coverage aspects of practical backscatter communication system in a smart city environment.},

Consequently, those networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. In this article, we review the foundations of such a future system. We first give an overview of the fundamental theoretical building blocks of WPT and WIPT. Then, we discuss some state-of-the-art experimental setups and prototypes of both WPT and WIPT, and contrast theoretical and experimental results. We draw special attention to how the integration of RF, signal, and system designs in WPT and WIPT leads to new theoretical and experimental design challenges for both microwave and communication engineers and highlight some promising solutions. Topics and experimental testbeds discussed include closed-loop WPT and WIPT architectures with beamforming, waveform, channel acquisition, and single-antenna/multiantenna energy harvester, centralized and distributed WPT, reconfigurable metasurfaces and intelligent surfaces for WPT, transmitter and receiver architecture for WIPT, modulation, and rate-energy tradeoff. Moreover, we highlight important theoretical and experimental research directions to be addressed for WPT and WIPT to become a foundational technology of future wireless networks.},

Firstly, we formulate a problem to optimize the active - and passive beamforming matrices with the goal of maximizing the sum rate (SR) of all users under the constraints of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. A state selection matrix is creatively introduced to control the number of RIS elements used for reflection. And quantized phases are considered in order to be more practical, which is often neglected in existing works. Then, an algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD) is proposed to obtain the stationary solution. The algorithm can guarantee the optimal SR regardless of any proportion of closed RIS elements. Finally, we perform simulation verification and analysis the results of the proposed scheme and six baseline schemes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is much better than the existing schemes in terms of SR, and realizes good energy efficiency (EE) performance simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve more significant EE gain by sacrificing less SR.},

The signal and interference links via the IRS are modeled with Rician fading. To reduce phase adjustment cost, we adopt quasi-static phase shift design where the phase shifts do not change with the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We investigate two cases of CSI at the BSs, namely, the instantaneous CSI case and the statistical CSI case, and apply Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) based on the complete CSI and the CSI of the Line-of-sight (LoS) components, respectively. Different costs on channel estimation and beamforming adjustment are incurred in the two CSI cases. First, we obtain a tractable expression of the average rate in the instantaneous CSI case and a tractable expression of the ergodic rate in the statistical CSI case. We also provide sufficient conditions for the average rate in the instantaneous CSI case to surpass the ergodic rate in the statistical CSI case, at any phase shifts. Then, we maximize the average rate and ergodic rate, both with respect to the phase shifts, leading to two non-convex optimization problems. For each problem, we obtain a globally optimal solution under certain system parameters, and propose an iterative algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent (PCD) to obtain a stationary point under arbitrary system parameters. Next, in each CSI case, we provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal quasi-static phase shift design is beneficial, compared to the system without IRS. Finally, we numerically verify the analytical results and demonstrate notable gains of the proposal solutions over existing ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers optimal quasi-static phase shift design for an IRS-assisted system in the presence of interference.},

Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN is able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart with half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.},

However, for a multiuser WET system, simultaneous multi-beam energy transmission is generally required to achieve the maximum performance, which may not be implemented by using the IRS having only a single set of coefficients. As a result, it remains unknowns how to exploit the IRS to approach such a performance upper bound. To answer this question, we aim to maximize the total harvested energy of a multiuser WET system subject to the user fairness constraints and the non-linear energy harvesting model. We first consider the static IRS beamforming scheme, which shows that the optimal IRS reflection matrix obtained by applying semidefinite relaxation is indeed of high rank in general as the number of energy receivers (ERs) increases, due to which the resulting rank-one solution by applying Gaussian Randomization may lead to significant loss. To achieve the multi-beam gain, we then propose a general time-division based novel framework by exploiting the IRS's dynamic passive beamforming. Moreover, it is able to achieve a good balance between the system performance and complexity by controlling the number of IRS shift patterns. Finally, we also propose a time-division multiple access (TDMA) based passive beamforming design for performance comparison.

PU has the right to access its dedicated channel at any time, while SU, operating in an opportunistic mode. can access only when PU is absent. Thus, SU should continuously monitor the channel to avoid any interference with PU when transmitting. Several factors, such as fading and shadowing adversely impact the PU SNR at the SU receiver making the Spectrum Sensing (SS) process more challenging. Recently, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) has been proposed to control the propagation channel for wireless systems. Introducing IRS in CR networks impacts the SS performance because of altering the channel. In this paper, we investigate the effect of deploying IRS on the SS by considering two scenarios: in (S1) the IRS is configured to enhance the PU signal at SU, while in the second scenario (S2), the IRS is configured to assist the Primary Receiver (PR). First, we highlight several important challenges and research directions. Then, we derive the analytical average detection probability for both (S1) and (S2). Results show that deploying IRS can significantly enhance SS even when the IRS is deployed to assist the PR.},

Many different and important designs are reviewed and compared. It is shown that metamaterials and metasurfaces can significantly improve the power transfer efficiency and operational distance for WPT systems. They can also improve the energy conversion efficiency of wireless energy harvesters by making the reception less sensitive to incident wave angle and polarization. A rectenna is a critical element for both WPT and WEH. It is shown that metamaterial-based rectennas can achieve a higher RF to dc conversion efficiency. Furthermore, metamaterials can also be used as either parasitic elements or loading components to improve WEH performance in terms of circuit size, beamwidth, and conversion efficiency. Future development directions and opportunities of metamaterials and metasurfaces for WPT and WEH are also proposed in this article.},

   abstract = {Digitally programmable metasurfaces are of potential use in wireless multiplexing techniques because they can encode and transmit information without using traditional radio-frequency components such as antennas or mixers. Space–time-coding digital metasurfaces can, in particular, manipulate the propagation direction and harmonic power distribution of electromagnetic waves, making them suitable for space- and frequency-division multiplexing. However, while digital metasurfaces have been used for wireless communication, these systems could implement signal modulation only in the time domain. Here, we report a wireless communication scheme that uses space–time-coding digital metasurfaces to implement both space- and frequency-division multiplexing. By encoding space–time-coding matrices through multiple channels, digital messages can be directly transmitted to different users at different locations simultaneously, without the need for digital-to-analogue conversion and mixing processes. To illustrate this approach, we have built a dual-channel wireless communication system based on a two-bit space–time-coding digital metasurface and use it to transmit two different pictures to two users simultaneously in real time.},

   abstract = {In a backscatter communication system, the backscatter device (BD) transmits its messages to the backscatter receiver (BR) by reflecting the incident signal from an external radio frequency (RF) emitter, instead of using power-hungry active RF components themselves. Thus, backscatter communication has shown great potential for achieving low-power communication. The double-fading effect associated with the backscatter link, however, is a major limiting factor to achieve efficient backscatter communication. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a recently developed technology, can be applied at the BD to enhance the backscatter link thanks to the fact that both RIS and backscatter communication share the same reflective principle. Such a design can also allow the backscatter communication system to capture the desired RF signal as a reflective carrier in a complex radio environment. In this article, a comprehensive overview of backscatter communication assisted by RIS is given. We first introduce the basics of backscatter communication, which covers the antenna scattering principle, backscatter modulation, and link budget calculation. Then, the details of RIS are discussed, which include antenna-based RIS and metamaterial-based RIS, followed by the discussion of the roles of RIS in backscatter communication. After that, we provide an overview of three types of backscatter communication systems assisted by RIS, including RIS-assisted unmodulated backscatter communication, RIS-assisted ambient backscatter communication, and RIS-assisted symbiotic radio. Emerging applications of these systems, technical challenges, and future opportunities in this emerging field are also presented.},

Wirelessly powered backscattering wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become particularly important to meet the upcoming era of the Internet of Things (IoT), which requires the massive deployment of self-sustainable and maintenance-free low-cost sensing and communication devices. This article will introduce the state-of-the-art antenna design and radio frequency (RF) system integration for wirelessly powered backscatter communications, covering both the node and the base unit. We capture the latest development in ultralow-power RF front ends and coding schemes for μ W-level backscatter modulators, as well as the latest progress in wireless power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH) techniques. Newly emerged rectenna system, waveform design, and channel optimization are reviewed in light of the opportunities for adaptively optimizing the WPT/EH efficiency for low-power signals with varying conditions. In addition, advanced device packaging and integration technologies in, e.g., additively manufactured RF components and modules for microwave and millimeter-wave ubiquitous sensing and backscattering energy-autonomous RF structures are reported. Inkjet printing for the sustainable and ultralow-cost fabrication of flexible RF devices and sensors will be reviewed to provide a prospective insight into the future packaging of backscatter communications from the chip-level design to complete system integration. Finally, this article will also address the challenges in fully wireless powered backscatter radio networks and discuss the future directions of backscatter communication in terms of 'Green IoT' and 'Low Carbon' smart home, smart city, smart skin, and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.},

It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of 'Is there any need for 6G?' by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of 'What 6G may look like?.' This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.},

   abstract = {To support massive access for future wireless networks, we propose a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enhanced downlink multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) symbiotic radio (SR) system. In the proposed system, each RIS not only enhances the primary transmission from the primary transmitter (PT) to the associated primary receiver (PR) nearby, but also acts as an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device to enable IoT transmissions to the same PR. Therefore, each PR needs to jointly decode the information from both the PT and its corresponding RIS. We are interested in maximizing the weighted sum-rate of both primary and IoT transmissions by jointly designing the active transmit beamforming at PT and the passive beamforming at each RIS under the maximum transmit power constraint at the PT and various constraints on the reflection coefficients (RCs), which include the ideal, continuous-phase and the discrete-phase cases. The formulated problem is non-convex, which cannot be solved directly. Thus, fractional programming (FP) method and alternating optimization (AO) technique are adopted to tackle the problem. In particular, three low-complexity algorithms are proposed to trade off between computational complexity and convergence rate. Compared to different benchmark schemes, simulation results demonstrate that with the aid of the RISs, the PRs can benefit from the enhanced primary transmission from the PT, and receive information from the associated RISs via IoT transmission.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance wireless information transmissions by adaptively controlling prorogation environment. Recently, the brand-new concept of utilizing IRS to implement a passive transmitter attracts researchers' attention since it potentially realizes low-complexity and hardware-efficient transmitters of multiple-input single/multiple-output (MISO/MIMO) systems. In this paper we investigate the problem of precoder design for a low-resolution IRS-based transmitter to implement multiuser MISO/MIMO wireless communications. Particularly, the IRS modulates information symbols by varying the phases of its reflecting elements and transmits them to K single-antenna or multi-antenna users. We first aim to design the symbol-level precoder for IRS to realize the modulation and minimize the maximum symbol-error-rate (SER) of single-antenna receivers. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, we first relax the low-resolution phase-shift constraint and solve this problem by Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Then, the low-resolution symbol-level precoding vector is obtained by direct quantization. Considering the large quantization error for 1-bit resolution case, the branch-and-bound method is utilized to solve the 1-bit resolution symbol-level precoding vector. For multi-antenna receivers, we propose to iteratively design the symbol-level precoder and combiner by decomposing the original large-scale optimization problem into several sub-problems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

Several ongoing approaches are being considered to overcome the grand challenge of the THz band, i.e., the limited communication distance. Among others, the use of new 2D nanomaterials such as graphene to create novel plasmonic devices that operate directly in the THz range and can be densely packed has been proposed. This paper presents a novel THz plasmonic array architecture which leverages the properties of graphene to greatly simplify its design and operation. Each element of the plasmonic array is an independent front-end, consisting of an on-chip plasmonic source, modulator and antenna. The advantages of this array architecture over conventional array architectures are discussed. The trade-offs in the design of the front-end and the array are exhaustively studied in transmission. The ability to perform continuous dynamic beamforming is presented. A new tailored algorithm is developed for beamforming weight selection. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the array for dynamic beamforming and increased power output.},

The aim is to have a smaller gradient (slower slope) of the reflected wave phase as a function of the elements' size to achieve a wider operational bandwidth and smaller susceptibility to manufacturing errors. The results obtained for single resonance elements demonstrate that a slower slope can be achieved using thicker substrates at the expense of an inadequate phase range of less than 300°. This inadequate phase range leads to the reflectarray elements phase errors, which reduce its directivity. To overcome this problem the use of multiresonance multiring elements is postulated. It is shown that square and circular shaped multiple rings printed on a thick substrate can offer a slower phase slope and the phase range exceeding 360°. The achieved slopes and ranges of double rings are comparable with those of double stacked patches printed on the equivalent low permittivity dielectric substrate. Choosing suitable dimensions of double-ring elements, the phase characteristic can be made approximately a linear function of their size. © 2008 IEEE.},

Due to the requirement of accurate estimation of backscatter channels (phase and amplitude), which is often distorted when multiple signals collide with each other, existing works are generally limited to either parallel decoding of collided signals or with non-collided signals only. Motivated by our observation that a channel can be distorted during collisions, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve channel properties of the respective tags, we propose the first approach to channel estimation of parallel 2backscattered signals, called Fireworks. We model the relationship between the channel and the signal moving trajectory in the In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) domain and implement this design in our lab. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate up to five channels in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2~4× improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

Upon deriving a convenient signal model, we exploit the fact that the radar clutter is periodic over time scales shorter than the coherence time of the environment, because so is the radar excitation, to distinguish the message sent by the tag from the superimposed ambient interference. In particular, we propose two encoding/decoding schemes that do not require any coordination with the radar transmitter or knowledge of the radar waveform. Different tradeoffs in terms of transmission rate and error probability can be obtained upon changing the control signal driving the tag switch or the adopted encoding rule; also, multiple tags can be accommodated with either a sourced or an unsourced multiple access strategy.},

Existing parallel decoding mechanisms, however, assume that signals of the tags are highly stable, and hence may not perform optimally in the naturally dynamic backscatter systems. This paper introduces FlipTracer, a practical system that achieves highly reliable parallel decoding even in hostile channel conditions. FlipTracer is designed with a key insight: although the collided signal is time-varying and irregular, transitions between signals' combined states follow highly stable probabilities, which offers important clues for identifying the collided signals, and provides us with an opportunity to decode the collided signals without relying on stable signals. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graphical model, called one-flip-graph (OFG), to capture the transition pattern of collided signals, and design a reliable approach to construct the OFG in a manner robust to the diversity in backscatter systems. Then FlipTracer can resolve the collided signals by tracking the OFG. We have implemented FlipTracer and evaluated its performance with extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that FlipTracer achieves a maximum aggregated throughput that approaches 2 Mbps, which is 6× higher than the state-of-the-art.},

Parallel backscatter is deemed as a promising technique for improving the overall throughput by enabling concurrent transmissions of the backscattering tags. The state-of-the-art approaches for parallel backscatter assume that all the states of the collided signals are distinguishable in the In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) signal plane. In this paper, we disclose the superclustering phenomenon that makes the assumption untenable and significantly degrades the overall performance. Moreover, we observe that the indistinguishable states at different channels are not the same due to the intrinsic channel diversity. Motivated by the observation, we propose Canon, an approach that exploits the channel diversity of the backscatter tags for reliable parallel decoding. In Canon, we address two critical challenges: (i) designing the Multi-Carrier Backscatter (MCB) module to extract the collided signals simultaneously from multiple channels, (ii) designing the Multi-Channel Cluster Union (MCCU) algorithm to distinguish each state of the collided signals. The experiments demonstrate that Canon can achieve over 10 times higher throughput than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we study a RIS aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) system, where the transmitter is equipped with a constant-envelope analog beamformer. First, we maximize the total received power of the users by jointly optimizing the beamformer at transmitter and the phase-shifts at the RIS, and propose two alternating optimization based suboptimal solutions by leveraging the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques respectively. Then, considering the user fairness, we formulate another problem to maximize the total received power subject to the users' individual minimum received power constraints. A low complexity iterative algorithm based on both alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and SCA techniques is proposed to solve this problem. In the case of multiple users, we further analyze the asymptotic performance as the number of RIS elements approaches infinity, and bound the performance loss caused by RIS phase quantization. Numerical results show the correctness of the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) systems offer significant advantages in coverage and deployment flexibility, but suffer from endurance limitations due to the limited onboard energy. This paper proposes to improve the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled WPT systems with multiple ground sensors by utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, the total energy consumption of the UAV is minimized, while meeting the energy requirement of each sensor. Firstly, we consider a fly-hover-broadcast (FHB) protocol, in which the UAV radiates radio frequency (RF) signals only at several hovering locations. The energy minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the UAV&#x2019;s trajectory, hovering time and the RIS&#x2019;s reflection coefficients. To solve this complex non-convex problem, we propose an efficient algorithm. Specifically, the successive convex approximation (SCA) framework is adopted to jointly optimize the UAV&#x2019;s trajectory and hovering time, in which a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm that maximizes the minimum charged energy of all sensors is provided to update the reflection coefficients. Then, we investigate the general scenario in which the RF signals are radiated during the flight, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV&#x2019;s trajectory, flight time and the RIS&#x2019;s reflection coefficients. By applying the path discretization (PD) protocol, the optimization problem is formulated with a finite number of variables. A high-quality solution for this more challenging problem is obtained. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the benefits of RIS in energy saving.},

In this context, we propose a simultaneous wireless power transfer and information transmission scheme for IoT devices with support from the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular, in the first phase, IoT devices harvest energy from the UAV through wireless power transfer; and then in the second phase, the UAV collects data from the IoT devices through information transmission. To characterise the agility of the UAV, we consider two scenarios: a hovering UAV and a mobile UAV. Aiming at maximizing the total network sum-rate, we jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV, the energy harvesting scheduling of IoT devices, and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS. We formulate a Markov decision process and propose two deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the total network sumrate. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the UAVs flying path optimization and the networks throughput of our proposed techniques compared with other benchmark schemes. Given the strict requirements of the RIS and UAV, the significant improvement in processing time and throughput performance demonstrates that our proposed scheme is well applicable for practical IoT applications.},

The narrow beams formed by millimeter wave (mmWave) beam can concentrate the transmission power and greatly improve the energy efficiency of WPT. However, the mmWave propagation is susceptible to blockage and suffers higher path-loss, resulting in low power intensity harvested by the devices in no line of sight (NLOS) state. In this paper, we propose a sectorized directional WPT scheme for wireless sensor network (WSN) assisted by the emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), where power beacon (PB) transfers energy to the devices in selected charging sectors, and the IRS is deployed in each sector to achieve high passive beamforming gain and provide additional effective reflection paths to enhance WPT efficiency drastically. We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by devices via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the PB and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual energy harvesting constraints of each device. To solve this non-convex problem, an efficient algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can increase the weighted sum-power by 15% and 26% compared to the two baseline methods.},

To this end, we adopt a physics-based IRS model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers.

   abstract = {This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) network, where multiple users decode data and harvest energy from the transmitted signal of a transmitter. The proposed design framework exploits the cost-effective IRS to establish favorable communication environment to improve the fair energy efficient. In particular, we study the max-min energy efficiency (EE) of the system by jointly designing the transmit information and energy beamforming at the base station (BS), phase shifts at the IRS, as well as the power splitting (PS) ratio at all users subject to the minimum rate, minimum harvested energy, and transmit power constraints. The formulated problem is non-convex and thus challenging to be solved. We propose two algorithms namely penalty-based and inner approximation (IA)-based to handle the non-convexity of the optimization problem. As such, we divide the original problem into two sub-problems and apply the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for both proposed algorithms to handle it iteratively. In particular, in the penalty-based algorithm for the first sub-problem, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique, difference of convex functions (DC) programming, majorization-minimization (MM) approach, and fractional programming theory are exploited to transform the non-convex optimization problem into a convex form that can be addressed efficiently. For the second sub-problem, a penalty-based approach is proposed to handle the optimization on the phase shifts introduced by the IRS with the proposed algorithms. For the IA-based method, we jointly optimize beamforming vectors and phase shifts while the PS ratio is solved optimally in the first sub-problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the IRS, which can significantly improve the system EE as compared to conventional benchmark schemes and also unveil a trade-off between convergence and performance gain for the two proposed algorithms.},

Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is utilized by the BS via transmit beamforming to convey information and power to all devices. Each device applies power splitting (PS) to dedicate separate parts of received power to information decoding and energy harvesting. We formulate a total transmit power minimization problem to jointly design the BS beamforming vectors, IRS phase shifts, and PS ratios at the receivers subject to minimum rate and harvested energy quality of service (QoS) constraints at all the receivers. First, we develop a block coordinate descent algorithm, also known as alternating optimization that can decrease the objective function in every iteration with guaranteed convergence. Afterwards, two low-complexity sub-optimal algorithms that rely on well-known maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing beamforming techniques are introduced. These algorithms are beneficial when the number of BS antennas and/or number of users is large, or coherence times of channels are small. Simulations corroborate the expectation that by deploying a passive IRS, BS transmit power can be reduced by 10–20 dBw while maintaining similar guaranteed QoS. Furthermore, even the proposed sub-optimal algorithms outperform the globally optimal SWIPT solution without IRS for a modest number of IRS elements.},

In this article, we investigate the IRS-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, where the active base station (BS) transmits beamforming and the passive IRS reflection coefficients are jointly optimized for maximizing the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all information decoders (IDs), while maintaining the minimum total harvested energy at all energy receivers (ERs). Moreover, the IRS with practical discrete phase shifts is considered, and thereby the max-min SINR problem becomes an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with a strong coupling among optimization variables. To explore the insights and generality of this max-min design, both the single-ID single-ER (SISE) scenario and the multiple-IDs multiple-ERs (MIME) scenario are studied. In the SISE scenario, the classical combinatorial optimization techniques, namely, the special ordered set of type 1 (SOS1) and the reformulation-linearization (RL) technique, are applied to overcome the difficulty of this max-min design imposed by discrete optimization variables. Then, the optimal branch-and-bound algorithm and suboptimal alternating optimization algorithm are, respectively, proposed. We further extend the idea of alternating optimization to the MIME scenario. Moreover, to reduce the iteration complexity, a two-stage scheme is considered aiming to separately optimize the BS transmit beamforming and the IRS reflection coefficients. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over the benchmarks in both the two scenarios.},

Our goal is to maximize the total EE of all WDs. To make full use of the beamforming gain provided by both the PS and the RIS, we jointly optimize the active beamforming of the PS and the passive beamforming of the RIS. To deal with the challenging non-convex optimization problem with multiple coupled variables, we first consider fixing the passive beamforming, and converting the remaining radio resource allocation problem into an equivalent convex problem which is solved by using Lagrange dual theory. Then, we fix the optimized resource allocation parameters and optimize the passive beamforming of the RIS by using a semidefinite programming method.

In existing scheme of massive connections, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), is investigated in conventional relaying networks. This method results in excessive power consumption and high hardware costs. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. This paper examines the RISs used in emerging communications systems based on NOMA scheme. The two-user system model contains the far user and the near user which employing RIS and NOMA is conducted in this study. In particular, we design two links (backscatter and direct links) to target to improve performance of far user. System performance was characterized through closed-form expressions of outage probability, ergodic capacity and throughput, which are beneficial to evaluate performance of two users. In Monte-Carlo simulations, it was revealed that the probability of the two users experiencing system outage was determined by factors related to power allocation, power transmission at the base station, and the number of reflecting elements in the RISs.},

   abstract = {Sixth generation (6G) mobile networks may include new passive technologies, such as ambient backscatter communication or the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, to avoid the emission of waves and the corresponding energy consumption. On the one hand, a reconfigurable intelligent surface improves the network performance by adding electronically controlled reflected paths in the radio propagation channel. On the other hand, in an ambient backscatter system, a device, named tag, communicates towards a reader by backscattering the waves of an ambient source (such as a TV tower). However, the tag's backscattered signal is weak and strongly interfered by the direct signal from the ambient source. In this paper, we propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted ambient backscatter system. The proposed surface allows to control the reflection of an incident wave coming from the exact source location towards the tag and reader locations (creating hot spots at their locations), thanks to passive reflected beams from a predefined codebook. A common phase-shift can also be applied to the beam. Thanks to these features, we demonstrate experimentally that the performance of ambient backscatter communications can be significantly improved.},

Nevertheless, the contemporary BackCom systems are limited to short-range and low data rate applications only, thus rendering them insufficient on their own to support pervasive connectivity among the massive number of IoT devices. Meanwhile, wireless networks are rapidly evolving towards the smart radio paradigm. In this regard, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have come to the forefront to transform the wireless propagation environment into a fully controllable and customizable space in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner. Targeting the sixth-generation (6G) horizon, we anticipate the integration of RISs into BackCom systems as a new frontier for enabling 6G IoT networks. In this article, for the first time in the open literature, we provide a tutorial overview of RIS-assisted BackCom (RIS-BackCom) systems. Specifically, we introduce the four different variants of RIS-BackCom and identify the potential improvements that can be achieved by incorporating RISs into BackCom systems. In addition, owing to the unrivaled effectiveness of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we present a case study on an RIS-assisted NOMA-enhanced BackCom system.

To fully exploit the passive beamforming gain of IRS in backscatter communication, channel state information (CSI) is indispensable but more practically challenging to acquire than conventional IRS-assisted systems, since IRS passively reflects signals over both the forward and backward (backscattering) links between the reader and tag. To address this issue, we propose in this letter a new and efficient channel estimation scheme for the IRS-assisted backscatter communication system. To minimize the mean-square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we formulate and solve an optimization problem by designing the IRS training reflection matrix for channel estimation under the constraints of unit-modulus elements and full rank.

In this paper, we examine how the presence of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) could benefit the bistatic BackCom system. We study the transmit power minimization problem at the carrier emitter, where its transmit beamforming vector is jointly optimized with the IRS phase shifts, whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. A unique feature in this system setup is the multiple IRS reflections experienced by signals traveling from the carrier emitter to the reader, which renders the optimization problem highly nonconvex. Therefore, we propose algorithms based on the minorization-maximization and alternating optimization techniques to obtain approximate solutions for the joint design. We also propose low-complexity algorithms based on successive optimization of individual phase shifts. Our results reveal considerable transmit power savings in both single-tag and multi-tag systems, even with moderate IRS sizes, which may be translated to significant range improvements using the original transmit power or a reduction of the reliance of tags on carrier emitters located at close range.},

   abstract = {Electromagnetic wave control using the concept of a reflecting surface is first studied as a near-field and a far-field problem. Using a secondary source present in a wireless communication environment, such as a backscatter tag, it is possible to leverage the incoming radiation from the source as a reference-wave to synthesize the desired wavefront across the reflecting surface, radiating a field of interest. In this geometry, the phase grating, which is synthesized using an array of sub-wavelength unit cells, is calculated by interacting the incident reference-wave with the desired wavefront, similar to a hologram. When illuminated by the reference-wave, the reflected wavefront from the calculated phase grating is guaranteed to constructively add in the direction of the desired radiation (beam-steering in the far-field) and also focus at the intended depth (beam-focusing in the radiative near-field). Next, leveraging a dynamic modulation mechanism in the context of an intelligent reflective surface (IRS) illuminated by a backscatter tag, we demonstrate that one can selectively focus and defocus at an arbitrarily positioned receiver within the 3D field of view of the reflecting surface. This enables the control of the amplitude of the radiated electric field at the receiver location, paving the way for a spatial modulation mechanism by means of reconfiguring the reflecting surface in a backscattered wireless communication environment. In addition to the phase modification approach on a unit cell level to reconfigure the aperture radiated wavefronts, we finally present a time varying IRS concept making use of a time-delay based approach relying on a delay adjustment between the reflection coefficients of the IRS' unit cell lattices.},

Particularly, as the number of IRS reflecting elements and/or that of IRS-served users increase, the channel training overhead becomes excessively high. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new anchor-assisted two-phase channel estimation scheme, where two anchor nodes, namely A1 and A2, are deployed near the IRS for helping the base station (BS) to acquire the cascaded BS-IRS-user channels. Specifically, in the first phase, the partial channel state information (CSI), i.e., the element-wise channel gain square, of the BS-IRS link is obtained by estimating the BS-IRS-A1/A2 channels and the A1-IRS-A2 channel, separately. Then, in the second phase, by leveraging such partial knowledge of the BS-IRS channel that is common to all users, the individual cascaded BS-IRS-user channels are efficiently estimated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed anchor-assisted channel estimation scheme is able to achieve comparable mean-squared error (MSE) performance as compared to the conventional scheme, but with significantly reduced channel training time.},

In this paper, we investigate an IRS-assisted multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) WPCN, where the single-antenna wireless devices (WDs) harvest wireless energy in the downlink (DL) and transmit their information simultaneously in the uplink (UL) to a common hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple antennas. Our goal is to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all the energy-harvesting users. To make full use of the beamforming gain provided by both the HAP and the IRS, we jointly optimize the active beamforming of the HAP and the reflecting coefficients (passive beamforming) of the IRS in both DL and UL transmissions, as well as the transmit power of the WDs to mitigate the inter-user interference at the HAP. To tackle the challenging optimization problem, we first consider fixing the passive beamforming, and converting the remaining joint active beamforming and user transmit power control problem into an equivalent weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem, where we solve it using an efficient block-coordinate descent (BCD) method. Then, we fix the active beamforming and user transmit power, and optimize the passive beamforming coefficients of the IRS in both the DL and UL using a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method. Accordingly, we apply a block-structured optimization (BSO) method to update the two sets of variables alternately. Numerical results show that the proposed joint optimization achieves significant performance gain over other representative benchmark methods and effectively improves the throughput performance in multiuser MISO WPCNs.},

   abstract = {This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where a hybrid access point (HAP) broadcasts energy signals to multiple devices for their energy harvesting in the downlink (DL) and then the devices use the harvested energy to transmit information signals to the HAP in the uplink (UL) with the help of an IRS. In particular, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations, namely fully dynamic IRS beamforming (FDBF), partially dynamic IRS beamforming (PDBF), and static IRS beamforming (SBF), to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. Moreover, we adopt a practical non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model, and leverage a power-splitting (PS) EH receiver architecture with multiple rectifiers to avoid the input radio frequency power to get stuck into the saturation regime. We aim to minimize the transmit energy consumption at the HAP by jointly optimizing the DL/UL time allocation, the HAP/devices transmit power, the PS factor, and IRS phase shifts, subject to a set of minimum throughput requirements for individual devices. To address the resulting non-convex optimization problems, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we study the case with the ideal linear EH model and two algorithms, namely SCA-based algorithm and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes and also unveil the importance of the joint design of IRS beamforming and PS rectifiers for achieving energy efficient WPCNs in practice.},

   abstract = {Passive technologies like ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) hold enormous potential for ubiquitous connectivity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in future wireless networks. However, despite many research efforts, AmBC has so far been unable to fulfil its potential for widespread deployment, due to the weakness of backscatter signal in the presence of strong direct-link interference from the original RF source. This limits the bit error rate (BER) and hence the transmission rate and range of AmBC systems. Meanwhile, the IRS offers new degrees of freedom in enhancing a variety of systems by transforming their propagation medium and signals. In this work, we devise a novel scheme to improve the detection performance of an AmBC system using an IRS located in its proximity. The IRS augments the backscatter signal quality at the receiver by adjusting its phase shifts to balance signal strengths, ultimately improving the performance of energy detection at the receiver. Our results clearly show that an IRS of reasonable size can considerably improve the BER performance of ambient backscatter, which is an important improvement for low power IoT systems.},

Non-metallic liquid antennas are further divided into water-based and non-water-based liquid antennas. We first review and compare different liquid antennas and highlight the major developments in the past. Detailed discussions on state-of-the-art designs and current technical challenges are then presented, and finally the ways forward for the future are suggested. As a special feature, an in-depth review and discussion on materials for liquid antennas are provided which was not well covered in the literature in the past, important properties of selected materials are given in three comparison tables which can serve as antenna material selection references. It is shown that Galinstan is probably the best choice for metallic liquid antennas while ionic liquid materials are the preferred choice for dielectric liquid antennas. The challenges of making the liquid antenna for real-world applications are identified and discussed. It is believed that a liquid antenna implemented in radio systems is probably just around the corner.},

   abstract = {The existing sub-6 GHz band is insufficient to support the bandwidth requirement of emerging data-rate-hungry applications and Internet of Things devices, requiring ultrareliable low latency communication (URLLC), thus making the migration to millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands inevitable. A notable disadvantage of a mmWave band is the significant losses suffered at higher frequencies that may not be overcome by novel optimization algorithms at the transmitter and receiver and thus result in a performance degradation. To address this, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is a new technology capable of transforming the wireless channel from a highly probabilistic to a highly deterministic channel and as a result, overcome the significant losses experienced in the mmWave band. This paper aims to survey the design and applications of an IRS, a 2-dimensional (2D) passive metasurface with the ability to control the wireless propagation channel and thus achieve better spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) to aid the fifth and beyond generation to deliver the required data rate to support current and emerging technologies. It is imperative that the future wireless technology evolves toward an intelligent software paradigm, and the IRS is expected to be a key enabler in achieving this task. This work provides a detailed survey of the IRS technology, limitations in the current research, and the related research opportunities and possible solutions.},

   abstract = {This article presents the design of 1-bit metasurfaces for radar cross section (RCS) reduction over wide frequency band from 60 GHz to 120 GHz. The proposed 1-bit metasurfaces can be designed without the need for any complicated optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA) or particle swarm algorithms (PSO), or time-consuming simulations to achieve the optimized phase distribution map. The phase distribution maps required for more than 10-dB RCS reduction of the proposed metasurfaces were generated using two-dimensional (2D) quick response (QR) 1-bit generator in MATLAB which are fast and efficient. After we carefully studied several metasurfaces with various 2D QR codes, it was found that the QR coded metasurfaces are very powerful in achieving more than 10-dB RCS reduction with low-level diffusive scattering patterns. Two metasurfaces with their unit cells phase distributions being exactly the same as the QR codes of the words -IEEE- and -Metasurface- were designed and their RCS reduction characteristics were investigated. For off-normal or oblique incidence, more than 10-dB RCS reduction is preserved up to incident angles of 60° over the entire frequency band. The simulation and measured results show the proposed QR coded metasurfaces reduce the backscattered energies and RCS by more than 10-dB for different polarizations over the frequency range from 60 GHz to 120 GHz yielding a fractional bandwidth of 66.7%. The proposed approach is powerful and fast and makes the realization of coding metasurface much easier.},

   abstract = {Deep learning (DL) based semantic communication methods have been explored for the efficient transmission of images, text, and speech in recent years. In contrast to traditional wireless communication methods that focus on the transmission of abstract symbols, semantic communication approaches attempt to achieve better transmission efficiency by only sending the semantic-related information of the source data. In this paper, we consider semantic-oriented speech transmission which transmits only the semantic-relevant information over the channel for the speech recognition task, and a compact additional set of semantic-irrelevant information for the speech reconstruction task. We propose a novel end-to-end DL-based transceiver which extracts and encodes the semantic information from the input speech spectrums at the transmitter and outputs the corresponding transcriptions from the decoded semantic information at the receiver. For the speech to speech transmission, we further include a CTC alignment module that extracts a small number of additional semantic-irrelevant but speech-related information for the better reconstruction of the original speech signals at the receiver. The simulation results confirm that our proposed method outperforms current methods in terms of the accuracy of the predicted text for the speech to text transmission and the quality of the recovered speech signals for the speech to speech transmission, and significantly improves transmission efficiency. More specifically, the proposed method only sends 16% of the amount of the transmitted symbols required by the existing methods while achieving about 10% reduction in WER for the speech to text transmission. For the speech to speech transmission, it results in an even more remarkable improvement in terms of transmission efficiency with only 0.2% of the amount of the transmitted symbols required by the existing method.},

The current communication technologies are already approaching the Shannon physical capacity limit with advanced encoding (decoding) and modulation techniques. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in the evolution from traditional communication technologies to the future. Semantic communication is one of the emerging communication paradigms, which works based on its innovative 'semantic-meaning passing' concept. The core of semantic communication is to extract the 'meanings' of sent information at a transmitter, and with the help of a matched knowledge base (KB) between a transmitter and a receiver, the semantic information can be 'interpreted' successfully at a receiver. Therefore, semantic communication essentially is a communication scheme based largely on AI.

Uniquely, spatial and frequency diversities are jointly exploited in the proposed WPT DAS with low complexity, low cost, and flexible deployment to combat the wireless fading channel. A numerical experiment is designed to show the benefits using antenna and frequency selections in spatially and frequency selective fading channels for single-user and multiuser cases. Accordingly, the proposed WPT DAS for single-user and two-user cases is prototyped. At the transmitter, we adopt antenna selection to exploit the spatial diversity and adopt frequency selection to exploit the frequency diversity. A low-complexity over-the-air limited feedback using an IEEE 802.15.4 RF interface is designed for antenna and frequency selections and reporting from the receiver to the transmitter. The proposed WPT DAS prototype is demonstrated in a real indoor environment. The measurements show that WPT DAS can boost the output dc power by up to 30 dB in a single-user case and boost the sum of the output dc power by up to 21.8 dB in the two-user case and broaden the service coverage area in a low cost, low complexity, and flexible manner.},

Wireless sensing has diverse Internet-of-Things applications in indoor human detection, such as in device-free localization, activity recognition and fall detection, respiration detection, gait recognition, user identification, and so forth. Deep learning (DL), with the latest breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), seems to be a feasible technique for device-free wireless sensing (DFWS) and human detection in a more intelligent and autonomous manner. Although DL has attracted wide spread attention in computer vision (CV), AI games, speech recognition, automated vehicles, and other fields, its application in wireless sensing systems (WSSs) is relatively new, and little attention has been paid to it. Motivated by these developments, this article clarifies the motivation and mechanism of the DL-aided WSSs for human detection. First, we survey the most advanced architecture of DL that may be powerful for WSSs. We also review conventional ML and DL approaches to human detection based on red green blue (RGB)/depth camera and radar: one reason is to introduce the successful experience in these areas to the field of wireless sensing and another reason is that the possibility of combining and fusing information from the heterogeneous types of sensors is expected to improve the overall performance of practical human detection systems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research on wireless sensing for human detection with a focus on WSSs. Furthermore, a general structure of the DL-based WSS is introduced in detail for hitherto unexplored applications and future wireless sensing scenarios. We also discuss some open research issues in wireless sensing for human detection, including data acquisition for DL model training, calibration of signals from commercial devices, multimodal sensing, simultaneous user identification and activity recognition, multiuser human detection, and generalization ability of DL models, to indicate future research directions.},

Since the number of antennas is very large for ELAA, the electromagnetic radiation field needs to be modeled by near-field spherical waves, which differs from the conventional planar-wave-based radiation model of 5G massive MIMO. As a result, near-field communications will become essential in 6G wireless networks. In this article, we systematically investigate the emerging near-field communication techniques. Firstly, we present the fundamentals of near-field communications and the metric to determine the near-field ranges in typical communication scenarios. Then, we investigate recent studies specific to nearfield communications by classifying them into two categories, i.e., techniques addressing the challenges and those exploiting the potentials in near-field regions. Their principles, recent progress, pros and cons are discussed. More importantly, several open problems and future research directions for near-field communications are pointed out. We believe that this article would inspire more innovations for this important research topic of near-field communications for 6G.},

Through broadening the scope of the traditional communication system and the AI-based encoding techniques, in this manuscript, we present a novel semantic communication system, which involves the essential semantic information exploration, transmission and recovery for more efficient communications. Compared to other state-of-the-art semantic communication-related works, our proposed semantic communication system is characterized by the &#x201C;flow of the intelligence&#x201D; via the propagation of the model. Besides, the concept of semantic slice-models (SeSM) is proposed to enable flexible model-resembling under the different requirements of the model performance, channel situation and transmission goals. Specifically, a layer-based semantic communication system for images (LSCI) is built on the simulation platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system and a novel semantic metric called semantic service quality (SS) is proposed to evaluate the semantic communication systems. We evaluate the proposed system on Cityscapes and Open Images datasets, resulting in averaged 10% and 2% bit rate reduction over JPEG and JPEG2000, respectively. In comparison to LDPC, the proposed channel coding scheme can averagely save 2dB and 5dB in AWGN channel and Rayleigh fading channel, respectively.},

In this case, DeepSC-IR is trained to optimize the distance in embedding space between images and DeepSC-MT is trained to minimize the semantic errors by recovering the semantic meaning of sentences. For the multimodal multi-user system, we develop a Transformer enabled model, named, DeepSC-VQA, for the VQA task by extracting text-image information at the transmitters and fusing it at the receiver. In particular, a novel layer-wise Transformer is designed to help fuse multimodal data by adding connection between each of the encoder and decoder layers. Numerical results show that the proposed models are superior to traditional communications in terms of the robustness to channels, computational complexity, transmission delay, and the task-execution performance at various task-specific metrics.},

@article{Yang2022c,
   abstract = {With the increasing demand for intelligent services, the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will shift from a traditional architecture that focuses solely on high transmission rate to a new architecture that is based on the intelligent connection of everything. Semantic communication (SemCom), a revolutionary architecture that integrates user as well as application requirements and meaning of information into the data processing and transmission, is predicted to become a new core paradigm in 6G. While SemCom is expected to progress beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, several obstacles need to be overcome on the way to a SemCom-enabled smart wireless Internet. In this paper, we first highlight the motivations and compelling reasons of SemCom in 6G. Then, we outline the major 6G visions and key enabler techniques which lay the foundation of SemCom. Meanwhile, we highlight some benefits of SemCom-empowered 6G and present a SemCom-native 6G network architecture. Next, we show the evolution of SemCom from its introduction to classical SemCom related theory and modern AI-enabled SemCom. Following that, focusing on modern SemCom, we classify SemCom into three categories, i.e., semantic-oriented communication, goal-oriented communication, and semantic-aware communication, and introduce three types of semantic metrics. We then discuss the applications, the challenges and technologies related to semantics and communication. Finally, we introduce future research opportunities. In a nutshell, this paper investigates the fundamentals of SemCom, its applications in 6G networks, and the existing challenges and open issues for further direction.},

   abstract = {Semantic communication, regarded as the breakthrough beyond the Shannon paradigm, aims at the successful transmission of semantic information conveyed by the source rather than the accurate reception of each single symbol or bit regardless of its meaning. This article provides an overview on semantic communications. After a brief review of Shannon information theory, we discuss semantic communications with theory, framework, and system design enabled by deep learning. Different from the symbol/bit error rate used for measuring conventional communication systems, performance metrics for semantic communications are also discussed. The article concludes with several open questions in semantic communications.},
